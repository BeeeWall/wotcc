He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for being a\n      ladies' man—he always had a woman on his arm.  After being\n      released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as\n      Lord Gaebril, and used Compulsion to have\n      Queen Morgase not only make him her advisor, but\n      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country\n      directly as the first ever King of Andor—he did his best to weaken\n      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who\n      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly\n      after news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien,\n      Rahvin was confronted and killed by Rand al'Thor in\n      Tel'aran'rhiod with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn\n      Rahvin's soul out of the pattern for days.\n      See also\n      Gaebril.\n  "}]}
