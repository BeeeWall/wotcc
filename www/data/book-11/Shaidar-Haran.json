He\n      is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who are the\n      height of an average man and all the same height.  His name means\n      “Hand of the Dark” in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal names\n      come from the Trolloc tongue.  He is given special consideration; the\n      ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head as it\n      does everyone else's.\n      See also\n      Dark One;\n      Moridin;\n      Nae'blis.\n  "}]}
