{"id":"Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere","name":"Lord Davram t'Ghaline Bashere","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 17:  A Bronze Bear","info":"Lord Davram t'Ghaline Bashere,\n      p. 369—Lord of Bashere, Tyr, and Sidonia; Guardian of the\n      Blightborder; Defender of the Heartland; Marshal-General to\n      Queen Tenobia of Saldaea.  He is also her uncle,\n      and Faile's father.  He has black eyes, a beak-like\n      nose, and a mustache.  He is also slender, and shorter than most men;\n      his wife towers over him.  He left Saldaea with his army on an order\n      from Tenobia to bring her the head of Mazrim Taim\n      after he escaped; he ended up in Caemlyn when Rand\n      defeated Rahvin.  He now commands Rand's troops in\n      Caemlyn (those that cannot channel and are not under the command of\n      Mat or one of the Aiel chiefs).  He is feared by any\n      potential opponents in battle, and with reason—he is one of the\n      best generals alive.\n      See also\n      t'Aybara, Faile ni Bashere.\n  "}]}
