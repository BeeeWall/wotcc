He is also slender, and shorter than most men;\n      his wife towers over him.  He left Saldaea with his army on an order\n      from Tenobia to bring her the head of <a href=\"#Taim\">Mazrim Taim</a>\n      after he escaped; he ended up in Caemlyn when <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>\n      defeated <a href=\"#Rahvin\">Rahvin</a>.  He now commands Rand&apos;s troops in\n      Caemlyn (those that cannot channel and are not under the command of\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> or one of the Aiel chiefs).  He is feared by any\n      potential opponents in battle, and with reason&#x2014;he is one of the\n      best generals alive.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Faile\">t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>.\n  "}]}
