{"id":"Aviendha","name":"Aviendha","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 13:  Siege","info":"Aviendha,\n      p. 310—Aiel of the\n      Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,\n      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had\n      the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of age with\n      Rand and Mat.  She is more than\n      pretty with her dark reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women\n      in Min's viewing of Rand—she also saw that she was\n      to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in\n      Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the\n      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became\n      unavailable and she tried bathing as “wetlanders” did; Rand\n      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she\n      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she\n      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,\n      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could\n      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the\n      night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar\n      incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about\n      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of\n      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She\n      felt toh toward Elayne for violating her\n      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her\n      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once\n      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a second\n      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has\n      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the\n      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is\n      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.\n      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves—a feat which\n      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She\n      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a\n      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely\n      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one\n      could do so without her knowing it immediately.\n      See also\n      al'Thor, Rand;\n      Farshaw, Elmindreda;\n      Trakand, Elayne.\n  "}]}
