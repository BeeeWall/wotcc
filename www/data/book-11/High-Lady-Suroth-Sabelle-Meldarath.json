{"id":"High-Lady-Suroth-Sabelle-Meldarath","name":"High Lady Suroth Sabelle Meldarath","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Embers Falling on Dry Grass","info":"High Lady Suroth Sabelle Meldarath,\n      p. 34—High Lady of Asinbayar and Barsabba, leader of Those Who Come\n      Before.  She has her head shaven on the sides and long, black hair in\n      the middle.  This is the typical Seanchan style for those “of the\n      Blood.”  Suroth was determined to redeem herself after\n      High Lord Turak's mishap at Falme—she did\n      not want to have to explain a failure that was not hers to the\n      Empress.  She gathered all of the Seanchan ships\n      that fled Falme so they would not go back home; she then retook portions\n      of the mainland again, but was prevented from taking Illian by\n      Rand and his Asha'man.  Known to few, Suroth is\n      Atha'an Shadar, “Those Bound to Shadow”\n      (a Darkfriend), and is high in their ranks.\n  "}]}
