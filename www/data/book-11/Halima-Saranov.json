{"id":"Halima-Saranov","name":"Halima Saranov","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 23:  Call to a Sitting","info":"Halima Saranov,\n      p. 487—Egwene's evening maid.  She is actually\n      Delana's maid, but she lends her to Egwene at\n      night to help with her chronic headaches.  Since she is actually\n      Aran'gar, a reincarnated Forsaken who channels\n      saidin despite being female; it is likely that she is\n      causing Egwene's headaches, and then making them subside, in\n      order to keep her close to Egwene.  She usually sleeps on a pallet in\n      Egwene's tent.  She is stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a\n      perfect face and a full, firm bosom.  As she is posing as a poorly\n      educated serving girl, she forms her letters with the awkwardness of a\n      young child.  She has developed a fondness for low-cut bodices.  She is\n      getting sloppy about bossing Delana around in public, leading\n      Romanda and others to believe that Delana and\n      Halima are “pillow friends.”\n  "}]}
