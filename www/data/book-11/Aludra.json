She was involved with the fireworks display\n      for King Galldrian of Cairhien that went awry\n      when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, though she\n      believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out\n      of the Illuminators&apos; Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the\n      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved\n      by <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> and <a href=\"#Thom\">Thom</a> in a barn, and as\n      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She later came to\n      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  He was knocked out\n      during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder, but Aludra escaped\n      and she now travels with Mat&apos;s entourage.  Since the Seanchan destroyed\n      the Chapter House of the Illuminators in Tanchico, Aludra may be the\n      last Illuminator alive.  <i>Note:  it is widely speculated that Aludra\n      is looking for a bellfounder for a specific reason:  she wants to build\n      a cannon.</i>\n  "}]}
