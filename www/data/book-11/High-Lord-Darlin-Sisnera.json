Rand says he almost\n      admired him—he opposed Rand from the very start, fleeing the Stone\n      of Tear when it fell and trying to rouse resistance among the rural\n      nobles.  He was considering Elaida's offer of\n      support if he declared himself king of Tear, until he was made the\n      Steward for the Dragon Reborn in Tear.  Rand\n      figures that this will keep the nobles scheming among themselves so much\n      that they will not have time to make trouble for him.\n  "}]}
