To protect the\n      Seanchan way of life—which would likely collapse if it was learned\n      that sul'dam could learn to channel—Seta retained her rank\n      as sul'dam, but was forbidden to be linked with a damane.\n      She was kept under close watch by Suroth.  She was\n      eventually taken along with Mat and the others that\n      left Ebou Dar.  She has yellow hair.\n  "}]}
