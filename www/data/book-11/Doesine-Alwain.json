Boyishly slim, and tall for a\n      Cairhienin.  Her father was a cutler.  She ran away three times as a\n      novice, although she only got as far as the gates once.  She has a bit\n      of a foul tongue.  She managed to get <a href=\"#Atuan\">Atuan</a>\n      questioned in the same manner <a href=\"#Talene\">Talene</a> was.  She and\n      <a href=\"#Saerin\">Saerin</a> walked in on <a href=\"#Seaine\">Seaine</a>\n      and <a href=\"#Pevara\">Pevara</a> when they were using the Oath Rod to\n      question sisters; she promptly booted Seaine out of the leadership and\n      seized the reins herself.  She has blue eyes.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Seaine\">Herimon, Seaine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.\n  "}]}
