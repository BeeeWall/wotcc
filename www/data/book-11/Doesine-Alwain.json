Boyishly slim, and tall for a\n      Cairhienin.  Her father was a cutler.  She ran away three times as a\n      novice, although she only got as far as the gates once.  She has a bit\n      of a foul tongue.  She managed to get Atuan\n      questioned in the same manner Talene was.  She and\n      Saerin walked in on Seaine\n      and Pevara when they were using the Oath Rod to\n      question sisters; she promptly booted Seaine out of the leadership and\n      seized the reins herself.  She has blue eyes.\n      See also\n      Herimon, Seaine;\n      Tazanovni, Pevara.\n  "}]}
