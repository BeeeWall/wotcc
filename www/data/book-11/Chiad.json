She is short for an Aiel\n      woman, and has blonde hair and gray eyes.\n      Gaul wants her to marry him, but she will not give\n      up the spear.  She is willing to be his lover, but marriage is out of\n      the question (or so she says).  She is first-sister to\n      Bain, and the two served as a sort of honor guard\n      for Faile.  She and Bain were captured along with\n      Faile by the Shaido and made gai'shain.  She has refused Faile's\n      offer of escape once her plan is ready; she vows to serve her year and a\n      day, as prescribed by ji'e'toh, and then walk away.  Chiad is\n      little more than a finger taller than her adopted first-sister.\n      See also\n      Bain;\n      Gaul.\n  "}]}
