{"id":"Couladin","name":"Couladin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 5:  Something…Strange","info":"Couladin,\n      p. 169—Self-appointed chief of the Shaido Aiel after the death of its\n      last true chief, Suladric.  He never went to\n      Rhuidean, but declared himself the\n      Car'a'carn after\n      Asmodean placed two dragons on his arms in a\n      copy of those on Rand's arms.  When the rest of the\n      Aiel chiefs declared for Rand, Couladin took the Shaido west across the\n      Spine of the World to ravage Cairhien.  Although almost every other clan\n      despises the Shaido, all agree that even they deserved a real\n      chief—they never got one.  Couladin died outside Cairhien while\n      fighting Mat Cauthon—Mat killed him, but later\n      remarked that Couladin had to have been born with a spear in his hands\n      to be that good.  After his death, the remnants of his clan fled to\n      Kinslayer's Dagger under the command of his widow,\n      Sevanna.  His head was placed on a pike while\n      Mat's troops danced around it and the rest of the Aiel spit on it.\n      See also\n      Sevanna.\n  "}]}
