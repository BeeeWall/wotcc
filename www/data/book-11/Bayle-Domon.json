His ship was captured by\n      Egeanin at Falme, and she was afraid Domon would\n      recognize her the next time they met.  She was right—he did.  He\n      is now one of Egeanin's so'jhin.  When Egeanin captured his ship,\n      he was trying to drop the male a'dam in the ocean.  The two are\n      now involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could stay\n      together), which no one else seems to understand—anyone who talks\n      to either of them seems to find them impossible to get along with.\n      See also\n      Shipless, Leilwin;\n      Tamarath, Egeanin.\n  "}]}
