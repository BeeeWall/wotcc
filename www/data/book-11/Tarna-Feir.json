{"id":"Tarna-Feir","name":"Tarna Feir","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Embers Falling on Dry Grass","info":"Tarna Feir,\n      p. 50—Aes Sedai of\n      the Red Ajah, now Keeper of the Chronicles in the\n      White Tower.  Elaida sent her to Salidar to\n      communicate with the Aes Sedai there and report about their camp and\n      their numbers.  She has long, pale, yellow hair, a strong jaw, and blue\n      eyes that could freeze the Sun.  She was a wilder, and had her block\n      beaten out of her by Galina Casban; she and Galina\n      were pillow friends as novices and/or Accepted, but Tarna rebuffed her\n      advances once she gained the shawl.  She is as\n      jumpy as a novice, but has a cold manner.  She came to\n      Pevara with a suggestion that Red sisters bond\n      Asha'man as Warders.  Note:  Tarna\n      says at one point that Galina “knew [her] Ajah long before [she]\n      did, and took a personal interest in [her].”  This is just\n      speculation, but I think it was the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina\n      knew she would choose.  It certainly fits with the idea of most Aes\n      Sedai in the Tower being Black, and with Galina's personal interest in\n      Tarna.  However, it has also been revealed that Galina's interest in\n      Tarna was more personal.\n      See also\n      Casban, Galina.\n  "}]}
