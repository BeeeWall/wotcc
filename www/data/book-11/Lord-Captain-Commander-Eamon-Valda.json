He killed Niall's assassin shortly\n      after the act, but it is not known whether this was set up, or whether\n      Valda just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  One of\n      his first acts was to dismiss Niall's secretary,\n      Sebban Balwer, for “someone who didn't\n      twitch.”  This was a mistake, as Balwer was Niall's\n      true Master of Spies—he knows more about spying than\n      anyone else in the world.  Valda offered assistance to\n      Morgase, as Niall had promised, but before doing\n      so he required a “service” of her:  to share his bed.\n      Morgase escaped during the Seanchan attack, and Valda believes her to be\n      dead.  He has since fallen into disfavor with the Children of the Light,\n      most especially with Galad, because of his dealings\n      with Morgase; Galad because she is his stepmother, and with the other\n      Children because she trained with the “witches” in Tar\n      Valon.\n      See also\n      Asunawa, Rhadam;\n      Balwer, Sebban;\n      Damodred, Galadedrid;\n      Niall, Pedron;\n      Trakand, Morgase.\n  "}]}
