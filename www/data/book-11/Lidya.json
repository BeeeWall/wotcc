She appears to have the Talent of\n      Foretelling—she was able to read Tuon's fortune, in a way, before\n      they landed at Ebou Dar.  She was caned because Tuon did not like what\n      she told her.  Tuon later apologized, realizing that Lidya had only told\n      the truth.  What Lidya told her was:  “Beware the fox that makes\n      the ravens fly, for he will marry you and carry you away.  Beware the\n      man who remembers Hawkwing's face, for he will\n      marry you and set you free.  Beware the man of the red hand, for him you\n      will marry and none other.”\nChapter 37:  Prince of the Ravens\n\n  "}]}
