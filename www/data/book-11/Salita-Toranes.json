{"id":"Salita-Toranes","name":"Salita Toranes","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 23:  Call to a Sitting","info":"Salita Toranes,\n      p. 478—Dark-skinned Sitter for the Yellow Ajah among the rebel Aes\n      Sedai.  She is from Tear, has a round face, and is almost as dark as the\n      Sea Folk.  She was raised to a Sitter after the sisters banded together\n      in Salidar.  She suggested a tax on the towns the Aes Sedai passed\n      through to raise money for the ever-growing army.  She has been an Aes\n      Sedai only 35 years, which is too young to be a sitter—most sitters\n      have worn the shawl over 100 years by the time they become sitters.  She\n      thinks it is wrong to sell objects made from cuendillar that they\n      have just made recently.  She also thinks the Yellows are being unfairly\n      drawn from Healing to make the objects (as if her Ajah's duty was more\n      important than that of other Ajahs).\n  "}]}
