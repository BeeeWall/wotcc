She is from Tear, has a round face, and is almost as dark as the\n      Sea Folk.  She was raised to a Sitter after the sisters banded together\n      in Salidar.  She suggested a tax on the towns the Aes Sedai passed\n      through to raise money for the ever-growing army.  She has been an Aes\n      Sedai only 35 years, which is too young to be a sitter&#x2014;most sitters\n      have worn the shawl over 100 years by the time they become sitters.  She\n      thinks it is wrong to sell objects made from <i>cuendillar</i> that they\n      have just made recently.  She also thinks the Yellows are being unfairly\n      drawn from Healing to make the objects (as if her Ajah&apos;s duty was more\n      important than that of other Ajahs).\n  "}]}
