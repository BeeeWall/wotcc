She has brown eyes and black hair (it was\n      shaven off as is the custom of those of the High Blood).  She\n      is also called the Daughter of the Nine Moons, the\n      woman Mat was told he will marry.  Mat has since\n      kidnapped her (in a matter of speaking), and she travels with him under\n      strictest secrecy.  She is very small—short and slender.  She is,\n      however, 20 years old, about the same age as Mat.  She has very long\n      eyelashes.  She is presumed dead by Suroth, but\n      Suroth is taking no chances and has sent parties out to find her.\n      See also\n      Cauthon, Matrim;\n      Daughter of the Nine Moons;\n      Dorje, Anath;\n      Empress (of Seanchan), The;\n      Paendrag, Aurana;\n      Paendrag, Chimal;\n      Paendrag, Radhanan;\n      Paendrag, Ravashi;\n      Selucia.\n  "}]}
