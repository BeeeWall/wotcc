He is 42 years old, born to weavers, and the property\n      of Jalid Magonine, a craftsman in Ancarid.  Furyk\n      started training for the Deathwatch Guards when he was fifteen.  He was\n      cited twice for heroism, and mentioned in dispatches three times.  After\n      seven years, after her birth, he was named to Tuon's\n      personal bodyguard, though that was not her name at the time (and using\n      that name now would be an insult to her).  He was one of only three\n      survivors of an attempt on Tuon's life, and was subsequently chosen for\n      officer training.  Later, he was injured again saving Tuon from\n      assassins; she gave him a doll, her most prized possession at the time.\n      Several years later, Karede was named to the\n      Empress's personal bodyguard, and sent with\n      High Lord Turak and the Hailene.  He kept\n      Tuon's doll for over ten years until it was destroyed in the Great Fire\n      of Sohima.  He has since requested to be on Tuon's bodyguard again no\n      fewer than three times.\n      See also\n      Paendrag, Tuon Athaem Kore.\n  "}]}
