{"id":"Moridin","name":"Moridin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 3:  At the Gardens","info":"Moridin,\n      p. 141—Name given to\n      the reincarnation of Ishamael.  His name\n      means “Death” in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name\n      more.  He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from\n      the Dark One; the saa have already appeared\n      in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most\n      thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the\n      saa appeared).  Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the\n      Pattern to behave how he wants it to—he knows that with someone as\n      strongly ta'veren as Rand, that is all but\n      impossible, not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep\n      everything in chaos (as per the Dark One's\n      command, “Let the Lord of Chaos Rule”), hoping that subtle\n      manipulations will further his goals.  He has been declared\n      Nae'blis, the one to be second only to the\n      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the\n      cour'souvra controlling the minds of\n      Cyndane and Moghedien.\n      He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True\n      Power—the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even\n      should they want to.\n      See also\n      Ishamael.\n  "}]}
