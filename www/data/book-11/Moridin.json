His name\n      means &#x201C;Death&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name\n      more.  He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from\n      the <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>; the <i>saa</i> have already appeared\n      in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most\n      thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the\n      <i>saa</i> appeared).  Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the\n      Pattern to behave how he wants it to&#x2014;he knows that with someone as\n      strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i> as <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, that is all but\n      impossible, not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep\n      everything in chaos (as per the <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>&apos;s\n      command, &#x201C;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule&#x201D;), hoping that subtle\n      manipulations will further his goals.  He has been declared\n      <a href=\"#Naeblis\">Nae&apos;blis</a>, the one to be second only to the\n      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the\n      <i>cour&apos;souvra</i> controlling the minds of\n      <a href=\"#Cyndane\">Cyndane</a> and <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>.\n      He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True\n      Power&#x2014;the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even\n      should they want to.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Ishamael\">Ishamael</a>.\n  "}]}
