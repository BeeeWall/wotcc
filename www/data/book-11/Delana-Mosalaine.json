She is from Shienar, and has no Warder.  Lately, Delana has been\n      causing trouble in the Hall, especially with her demands to make a\n      formal declaration that <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> is Black Ajah.  She\n      is willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters\n      will not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her\n      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of\n      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named\n      <a href=\"#Halima\">Halima</a>, and she often lent her to Egwene; Halima\n      was the only person who seems to be able to make Egwene&apos;s headaches go\n      away.  Halima, of course, was <em>causing</em> Egwene&apos;s headaches, but\n      she was not aware of that.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Halima\">Saranov, Halima</a>.\n  "}]}
