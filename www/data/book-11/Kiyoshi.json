Alviarin commanded\n      Elaida to uphold her as a model sister, and\n      present her with the gift of a new horse.  This came right after Elaida\n      found angreal in the rooms of Josaine and\n      Adelorna; the obvious intent was to imply that\n      Kiyoshi helped turn one of them in.  It is unknown whether Kiyoshi is\n      Black Ajah, or if she simply was chosen by Alviarin as a convenient\n      person.  She is tall, slender, and a stickler for punctuality and\n      neatness.\n  "}]}
