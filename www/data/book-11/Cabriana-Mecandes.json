Her identity was used to give <a href=\"#Halima\">Halima</a> a\n      reason to know things about Aes Sedai, since she claimed to be her\n      servant.  She was one of three sisters referred to by Blues as The\n      Three because they were so close.  The other two were\n      <a href=\"#Anaiya\">Anaiya</a> and <a href=\"#Kairen\">Kairen</a>.  The\n      Three <em>never</em> talked of their affairs except with each other.\n      <i>Editor&apos;s note:  it stands to reason that Anaiya and Kairen were\n      killed by Halima because they asked the wrong questions about Cabriana\n      and Halima gave the wrong answers.</i>\n  "}]}
