{"id":"Bethamin-Zeami","name":"Bethamin Zeami","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 7:  A Cold Medallion","info":"Bethamin Zeami,\n      p. 196—Sul'dam who was left behind after the battle at\n      Falme, later captured by Egeanin.  When Egeanin\n      found her, she tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the a'dam\n      she was carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier\n      to the woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the\n      a'dam should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring\n      around her head).  Much to Egeanin's surprise, the a'dam held\n      Bethamin just as well as it held the damane it was intended for.\n      Bethamin already knew this, from observing Renna,\n      who Egwene left collared after Falme.  From this,\n      and from Nynaeve's and\n      Elayne's information about the possibility of\n      learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that\n      all sul'dam, including Bethamin, could channel if they were\n      taught—which went against everything she had been taught her\n      entire life.  Bethamin is now forbidden to be linked to damane,\n      both as protection for her—if anyone besides\n      Suroth knew that the a'dam would control\n      her, they would probably make her wear it all the time—and as\n      protection for the Seanchan way of life, which would likely collapse if\n      it was learned that sul'dam could channel just as well as\n      damane.  She has since been spirited away from Ebou Dar\n      with Mat, Egeanin, and the rest of the group that\n      fled Ebou Dar.\n  "}]}
