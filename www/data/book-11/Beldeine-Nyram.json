She has no Warders, which is extremely unusual\n      for a Green.  She was raised to the shawl about three years ago, and as\n      yet is too new to the shawl to have the ageless look.  She was captured\n      at Dumai&apos;s Wells and is now a prisoner of the Aiel.  According to\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewing of her, she will bond one of the\n      Asha&apos;man as a Warder.  She is pretty, and has high cheekbones and\n      slightly tilted brown eyes.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Karldin\">Manfor, Karldin</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
