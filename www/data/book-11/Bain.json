{"id":"Bain","name":"Bain","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 5:  Something…Strange","info":"Bain,\n      p. 165—Maiden of\n      the Spear of the Black Rock sept of the Shaarad Aiel.  She has\n      flame-colored hair and dark blue eyes.  She is first-sister to\n      Chiad, of the Goshien Aiel; the two had to sneak\n      through the camp of the other to find the Wise Ones to become first\n      sisters, since their clans were in blood feud at the time.  She later\n      became one of the Maidens who accompanied Faile, a\n      similar honor guard to what Rand has, although\n      smaller and for different reasons.  She and Chiad were both captured by\n      the Shaido along with the rest of Faile's company, and made\n      gai'shain.  She has refused Faile's offer of escape once her plan\n      is ready; she vows to serve her year and a day, as prescribed by\n      ji'e'toh, and then walk away.\n      See also\n      Chiad.\n  "}]}
