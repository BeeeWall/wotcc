She is\n      young (she has worn the shawl for about fifteen years) and known for\n      her temper.  She is now the Captain-General of the Green Ajah of the\n      Tower-in-exile.  She has four Warders named <a href=\"#Nuhel\">Nuhel</a>,\n      Croi, <a href=\"#Avar\">Avar</a>, and most recently\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>, <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>&apos;s old Warder\n      who she is trying to save.  She treats all of them as husbands in\n      defiance of all law and custom, inside the Tower and out.  She fled the\n      White Tower when <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a> was deposed, along with most\n      of her Ajah.  She was one of the six sisters who held much of the power\n      in Salidar despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.  She\n      received <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s bond after\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>&apos;s death, bringing her Warder count to\n      four, at least until <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> is ready to have him\n      as a Warder.  She seems to be the resident expert on saving Warders;\n      three of her four (Nuhel, Avar, and Lan) were previously bonded to other\n      sisters.  She claims this is because she hates watching Warders die once\n      their Aes Sedai is dead.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Nuhel\">Dromand, Nuhel</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Avar\">Hachami, Avar</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Llyw\">Llyw</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Mandragoran, Lan</a>.\n  "}]}
