{"id":"Nicola-Treehill","name":"Nicola Treehill","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Embers Falling on Dry Grass","info":"Nicola Treehill,\n      p. 87â€”Slender,\n      black-haired, dark-eyed novice; she is about\n      Nynaeve's age.  She was a refugee from Ghealdan.\n      She has already developed several Talents, including the ability to see\n      ta'veren and Foretelling, although what she Foretells is usually\n      in such language that only poets can understand it.  Her potential\n      exceeds that of all Aes Sedai currently alive, with the exception of\n      Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve.\n      She has a limited ability to make cuendillar, but she is\n      impatient in learning.  She is very arrogant and can also be deceitful;\n      she once tried to blackmail Egwene,\n      Myrelle, and Nisao.  She\n      used the fact that she could Foretell to be even more arrogant and\n      demand even more special treatment.  When Egwene refused to grant her\n      that treatment, she ran away to the White Tower, thinking they would let\n      her progress at the pace she wanted.  She could not have been more\n      incorrect, of course, and her life in the Tower is no doubt even more\n      abysmal than it was before.  It will get even worse if a sister ever\n      finds out that she lied about her age; she is too old to be entered into\n      the novice book by Tower law.\n      See also\n      Nermasiv, Areina.\n  "}]}
