She had an extreme dislike for\n      Wilders, and did not treat Siuan and\n      Leane very well when they were stilled, either.\n      She spent eight years as a novice, and five among the Accepted.  She was\n      among the four raised to full sisterhood by\n      Egwene.  She is still treated as an Accepted by\n      most of the sisters.  She swore to obey Egwene of her own volition, but\n      she disappeared recently.  Lelaine has recently\n      admitted to holding her captive and pressing her “rather\n      hard,” as penalty for spying on her.\n  "}]}
