She has actually\n      been of the Black Ajah for all but five of her almost ninety years\n      wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among the Black sisters.\n      She and <a href=\"#Tarna\">Tarna</a> were pillow friends as novices or Accepted;\n      Tarna refused her advances after gaining the shawl&#x2014;she had since\n      come to realize that she prefers the attentions of men, despite her\n      choice of the Red Ajah.\n      She led the expedition to bring <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> to Tar Valon after\n      he was shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at\n      Dumai&apos;s Wells, and is now a prisoner of <a href=\"#Sevanna\">Sevanna</a>\n      and <a href=\"#Therava\">Therava</a>.  Galina has long black hair without\n      a touch of gray in it.  She claims to have helped break two\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin</a>&apos;s as a Black sister&#x2014;one\n      (<a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>) was deposed and stilled, and the\n      other (Tamra Ospenya) was made to appear that she\n      had died in her sleep.  She led the circle that stilled Siuan.\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Pevara</a> firmly did not want to believe that Galina\n      was Black, despite <a href=\"#Talene\">Talene</a>&apos;s suspicions that she\n      was.  When Galina&apos;s loyalties were proven, presumably by an\n      inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage\n      for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands.\n      Galina now serves Sevanna and often shares her tent.  She is pretty, but\n      nowhere near beautiful.  The White Tower presumes her to be dead at the\n      battle of Dumai&apos;s Wells.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Alyse\">Alyse</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Lina\">Lina</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Talene\">Minly, Talene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Sevanna\">Sevanna</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.\n  "}]}
