She has a special ability that few\n      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,\n      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha&apos;man, that foretell their\n      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when\n      she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when.\n      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included\n      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,\n      one of which was herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for\n      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a\n      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she\n      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon\n      helping <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a> with her viewings&apos; information when\n      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane</a> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two\n      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for\n      Caemlyn with Salidar&apos;s embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought\n      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She\n      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she\n      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is\n      one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the\n      <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon Reborn</a>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a\n      Warder bond that she shares with the other two,\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a> and <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.  She\n      is fond of reading books by the late <a href=\"#Fel\">Herid Fel</a>, a\n      philosopher who worked in Rand&apos;s school of thought and was killed by a\n      <i>gholam</i> or Slayer, presumably because he had stumbled upon\n      information crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.  She had a viewing of\n      Elayne just before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant\n      with twins; she told half the palace before Elayne herself\n      knew.&#x2026;\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>.\n  "}]}
