Elaida named her to lead the team of\n      fifty sisters that she sent to Caemlyn to attempt to capture any men who\n      can channel that they found.  Unfortunately, she and Elaida drastically\n      underestimated the number of men there would be, and Toveine is now\n      <a href=\"#Logain\">Logain</a>&apos;s &#x201C;wife,&#x201D; their equivalent to\n      Warders (actually, Logain has <i>two</i> such wives now).  Though she\n      used to hate all men who could channel, and Logain in particular, she\n      now fawns over him.  She is short, and has coppery skin.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Logain\">Ablar, Logain</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gabrelle\">Gabrelle</a>.\n  "}]}
