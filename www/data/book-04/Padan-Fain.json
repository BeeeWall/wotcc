The true purpose of his visits were to find a list of young men\n      who might be the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>&#x2014;he was\n      collecting this information as a Darkfriend, passing it on to\n      <a href=\"#Ishamael\">Ishamael</a> when he was able to narrow the list.\n      He finally selected three possible:  <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>, and <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>,\n      who were born within weeks of one another during the Aiel War.  Fain was\n      then given orders to follow the three men, and on the way went through\n      Shadar Logoth, where he encountered the spirit of\n      Mordeth.  Mordeth attempted to consume his soul and take over his\n      body, but instead the two spirits merged, creating something more evil\n      than either of them alone.  Fain eventually hooked up with the Children\n      of the Light, and managed to become advisor to\n      <a href=\"#Niall\">Pedron Niall</a>,\n      the Lord Captain Commander of the Children, using the name\n      <a href=\"#Ordeith\">Ordeith</a>.  Fain is a very dangerous man:  it is\n      said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless (Myrddraal) is fear.&#x201D;\n      However, Fades have the same feeling of fear looking at Fain as normal\n      people have looking at Myrddraal.  Fain is likely the most dangerous\n      creation in the world, with the possible exception of the\n      <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a> himself.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Ordeith\">Ordeith</a>.\n  "}]}
