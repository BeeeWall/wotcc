He is fond of books and history, and is an\n      excellent Treesinger.  He is writing a book about his travels with the\n      three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he meets, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>, and <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>.\n      Loial is constantly afraid that his mother will find him and try to\n      marry him off and settle him down; he is only ninety years old, which by\n      Ogier standards is not yet old enough to leave the <i>stedding</i> by\n      himself.  Loial is sad that most humans do not remember the\n      Ogier&#x2014;and horrified that some see him and think he is a\n      Trolloc.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Arent\">Arent</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Halan\">Halan</a>.\n  "}]}
