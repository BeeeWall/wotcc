Thom is good\n      at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks.  He also\n      carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in\n      various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread\n      from Thom to <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> and <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a>.  Thom\n      was originally a bard in <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal\n      Court, and for a time after her husband\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Taringail Damodred</a> died, he was the Queen&apos;s\n      lover.  During his fight with a Fade near Shadar Logoth, he was injured,\n      and now walks with a limp because of it.  Thom is getting old, such that\n      he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and other\n      stunts he used to do.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Owyn\">Merrilin, Owyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
