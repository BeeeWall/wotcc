It is also the name Min assumes while in the Tower to\n      make certain people do not learn her true identity.  Min has a special\n      ability that few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras\n      around people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that Foretell\n      their futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but\n      when she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and\n      when.  Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included\n      herself:  three different women are destined to fall in love with him,\n      one of which is herself.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>.\n  "}]}
