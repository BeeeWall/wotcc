When Egeanin found her, she\n      tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the <i>a&apos;dam</i> she was carrying\n      around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier to the woman\n      fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the <i>a&apos;dam</i>\n      should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring around her head).\n      Much to Egeanin&apos;s and Bethamin&apos;s surprise, the <i>a&apos;dam</i> held\n      Bethamin just as well as it held the <i>damane</i> it was intended for.\n      From this, and from <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>&apos;s and\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>&apos;s information about the possibility of\n      learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that\n      all <i>sul&apos;dam</i>, including Bethamin, could channel if they were\n      taught&#x2014;which went against everything she had been taught her\n      entire life.\n\n\n  "}]}
