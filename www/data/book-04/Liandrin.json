She is one of three Black sisters that\n      <a href=\"#Amico\">Amico</a> knew of before leaving the Tower.  She has a\n      face like a doll.  Liandrin was Red Ajah before turning Black, but her\n      oath to the Black was sworn only days (perhaps hours) after her raising\n      to the shawl, so it cannot really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at\n      all.  Her father sold fruit on the street.\n  "}]}
