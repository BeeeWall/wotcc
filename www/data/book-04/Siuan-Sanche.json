Born to a fisherman in Tear, she\n      was sent to Tar Valon aboard the first boat to sail the morning she\n      learned she could channel the One Power, in accordance with Tairen law.\n      She has eyes that make even the most powerful ruler cower and try to\n      please her just so she looks away.\n      She is the youngest Amyrlin ever raised; she was only thirty\n      years old when she assumed the Seat.\n      She and <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine Damodred</a> were good friends as\n      Novices and Accepted, but walked away from each other after being\n      raised to the shawl.\n      Siuan fears she is nearly alone in the Tower, not knowing who to trust,\n      who might be a Darkfriend.  As such, she enlisted three Accepted with a\n      mission:  to track down members of the Black Ajah and do what she could\n      trust no sister to do.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Alric\">Alric</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Sharif, Leane</a>.\n  "}]}
