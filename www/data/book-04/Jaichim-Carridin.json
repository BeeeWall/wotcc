He frequents the Garden of Silver Breezes, an inn in\n      Tanchico, and is the only man <a href=\"#Selindrin\">Selindrin</a> allows\n      to enter the inn armed.  Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less\n      a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend.  He was given orders (under the\n      name <a href=\"#Bors\">Bors</a>) by <a href=\"#Ishamael\">Ishamael</a> to\n      find and kill <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and those orders were\n      strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of\n      Carridin&apos;s family every month until al&apos;Thor was dead.  So far, Carridin\n      has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest\n      sister <a href=\"#Dealda\">Dealda</a> (carried from her bridal feast by a\n      Fade).
