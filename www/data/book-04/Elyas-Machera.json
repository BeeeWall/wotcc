He didn&apos;t find any problem with the\n      ability by itself, but felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who\n      thought they should gentle him (even though there was nothing to be\n      gentled) because of his ability.  Elyas helped Perrin learn that he\n      could talk to wolves as well; Perrin does not necessarily like the\n      ability, but has gotten over the dislike of it as well.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Aybara, Perrin</a>.\n  "}]}
