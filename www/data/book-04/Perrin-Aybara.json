He is <i>ta&apos;veren</i>.  When he and\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the group\n      while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named\n      <a href=\"#Elyas\">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he\n      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself.\n      Perrin&apos;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&apos; eyes, and he can\n      enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.\n      Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&apos;veren</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>.\n      On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of\n      <a href=\"#Zarine\">Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who\n      took the name of <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a> (which means\n      &#x201C;Falcon&#x201D; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for\n      a hunter for the horn.  The two have grown to love each other.\n      Perrin is a very large man&#x2014;he was always a big person,\n      which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he\n      could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand.\n      His size helped considerably when helping\n      <a href=\"#Luhhan\">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but sometimes gives\n      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Adora\">Aybara, Adora</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Carlin\">Aybara, Carlin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Con\">Aybara, Con</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Deselle\">Aybara, Deselle</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Ealsin\">Aybara, Ealsin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Eward\">Aybara, Eward</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Neain\">Aybara, Neain</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Faile\">Bashere, Faile</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Zarine\">Bashere, Zarine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Cilia\">Cole, Cilia</a>.\n  "}]}
