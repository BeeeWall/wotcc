At the moment of Creation,\n      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.\n      This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored\n      into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore,\n      allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new\n      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free\n      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the\n      War of Power by some), during which a number of important leaders\n      forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people\n      are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes\n      Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow did not end until\n      <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to\n      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison.\n      At the moment of sealing, Shai&apos;tan lashed out at those sealing the\n      prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i> itself,\n      the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to insanity\n      as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are weakening\n      now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once\n      again able to exert influence on the world.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Baal\">Ba&apos;alzamon</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Creator\">Creator, The</a>.\n  "}]}
