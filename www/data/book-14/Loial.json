He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to\n      see the world; by Ogier standards, he was not yet old enough to leave the\n      <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is\n      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is\n      writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he\n      meets, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>,\n      and <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>.\n      Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to\n      marry him off and settle him down; however,\n      he does like his mother&apos;s choice of wives for him,\n      <a href=\"#Erith\">Erith</a>.  He, like most of the Ogier,\n      is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that\n      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.\n      Loial&apos;s mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now\n      married.  He spoke to the Stump at Stedding Shangtai, convincing them\n      to intervene in the Last Battle.\n      Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually be called\n      <i>The Dragon Reborn</i> and will catalog\n      everything he has been through with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> as well as\n      any details he has been able to pry out of them.  He has always had a\n      secret desire to be hasty, as he perceives all humans to be.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Arent\">Arent</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Erith\">Erith</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Halan\">Halan</a>.\n  "}]}
