His ship was captured by\n      <a href=\"#Tamarath\">Egeanin</a> at Falme, and she was afraid Domon would\n      recognize her the next time they met.  She was right&#x2014;he did.  He\n      became one of Egeanin&apos;s <i>so&apos;jhin</i>.  When Egeanin captured his ship,\n      he was trying to drop the male <i>a&apos;dam</i> in the ocean.  The two\n      became involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could stay\n      together), which no one else seemed to understand&#x2014;anyone who talks\n      to either of them seems to find them impossible to get along with.\n      He is now <a href=\"#Leilwin2\">Leilwin</a>&apos;s husband and used to be\n      <i>so&apos;jhin</i> until they fled the Seanchan provinces.\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> describes him as &#x201C;not to bad a guy&#x201D; except\n      when he is around Leilwin.
