In reality, Murandians held\n      allegiance to lords only, and those lords often refused to pay their\n      taxes to the King.  He has, however, made himself the first <i>true</i>\n      king of Murandy in its history by deft manipulation of the nobles&apos;\n      unease about the Borderlander, Andoran, and Aes Sedai presences on\n      Murandian soil.  <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> sent an invitation and an offer of\n      Traveling to him so he could attend the meeting with Rand and the\n      world&apos;s rulers, but she doubts he will attend.  She was wrong; he\n      arrived at Merrilor at the last minute.  He is described as a corpulent\n      man with thinning hair, more white than black.\n  "}]}
