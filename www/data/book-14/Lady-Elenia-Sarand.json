She has a\n      vulpine face and keeps her golden hair in a bun.\n      Her husband <a href=\"#Jarid\">Jarid</a> opposed\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a> during the Succession.\n      <a href=\"#Dyelin\">Dyelin</a> exiled her from Caemlyn, as Morgase did\n      long ago, for attempting to take the Lion Throne.  She still\n      planned to take it from <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>, though once she was\n      rescued from Aringill by Arymilla&apos;s men, her\n      claim vanished.  Her House later supported Arymilla for the Lion\n      Throne and the Rose Crown of Andor.  However, she thinks Arymilla\n      &#x201C;lacks the wit&#x201D; to be queen, and Elayne too\n      immature&#x2014;she is also not above causing &#x201C;accidents&#x201D;\n      for her rivals.  Elayne imprisoned her after Arymilla&apos;s failed attempt\n      to take the Throne.  Her husband still holds out the hope of seizing\n      Caemlyn and putting her on the throne, but Elayne&apos;s position may be too\n      strong for that now.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Jarid\">Sarand, Jarid</a>.\n  "}]}
