He accepted partly\n      out of respect for Lan, and partly out of guilt; he betrayed Elayne,\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>, and Nynaeve to the Black Ajah when\n      Liandrin used Compulsion on him, and later\n      realized how wrong it was.  He carries a notched sword-breaker and a\n      staff with which he is deadly; he could make a Whitecloak appear\n      relaxed.  He has fallen in love with\n      <a href=\"#Amathera\">Amathera</a>, the Panarch of Tarabon.  He traveled\n      with <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a> for a time, and is now the leader\n      of a squad tasked with protecting the Aes Sedai from the Sharan\n      infantry.  He has no idea how he came to command troops, or why anyone\n      would trust him to do so.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Amathera\">Lounault, Amathera Aelfdene Casmir</a>.\n  "}]}
