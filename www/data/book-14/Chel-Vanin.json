He is a good rider, and Mat\n      thinks he could steal a hen pheasant&apos;s eggs with her sitting on them\n      (although he would likely steal her, too)&#x2014;he also thinks Vanin\n      could steal a horse out from under a nobleman and he would not know it\n      for two days.  He has a large space between his front teeth.  He went\n      with Mat to Ebou Dar, and escaped the city with Mat to travel with\n      Valan Luca&apos;s show.  Mat discovered him by asking the\n      me he <i>did</i> catch stealing who the best thieves were.  He then\n      asked the men <i>they</i> named the same thing.  Vanin was the one named\n      by the third or fourth group; he is the best Mat has ever seen.\n      Mat sent him with Joline and the other Aes Sedai to Tar\n      Valon to gather information.
