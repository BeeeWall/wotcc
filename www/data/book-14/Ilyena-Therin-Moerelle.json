According to the memories of Lews\n      Therin&apos;s that used to flash through <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>&apos;s head, Ilyena\n      never flashed her temper at Lews Therin when she got angry at herself.\n      Lews Therin often wailed for her loss for hours on end; these rants were\n      usually started by anything and everything having to do with women,\n      love, hate, killing, friends, or enemies.  It is evident that\n      <a href=\"#Demandred\">Demandred</a> also fancied Ilyena, and the fact that she fell\n      for Lews Therin only deepened his hatred of him.  She was the last of\n      the names expunged from Rand&apos;s list.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Lews\">Telamon, Lews Therin</a>.\n  "}]}
