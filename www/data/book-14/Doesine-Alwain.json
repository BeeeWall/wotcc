Boyishly slim, and tall for a\n      Cairhienin.  Her father was a cutler.  She ran away three times as a\n      novice, although she only got as far as the gates once.  She has a bit\n      of a foul tongue.  She managed to get Atuan\n      questioned in the same manner Talene was.  She and\n      <a href=\"#Saerin\">Saerin</a> walked in on <a href=\"#Seaine\">Seaine</a>\n      and <a href=\"#Pevara\">Pevara</a> when they were using the Oath Rod to\n      question sisters; she promptly booted Seaine out of the leadership and\n      seized the reins herself.  She has blue eyes and wears a sapphire on her\n      forehead in the Cairhienin style.  She and Seaine were charged with\n      determining whether it was possible to fool or circumvent the Oath Rod;\n      they discovered an alteration to the Mask of Mirrors that would allow\n      the user to distort the <i>words</i> they were saying, so that they\n      could in fact say anything at all (with approximately the same length\n      sentences, at least) and have everyone else hear something else.  She\n      retains her position as a Sitter now that Tower has reunited.\n  "}]}
