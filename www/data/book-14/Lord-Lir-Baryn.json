He was one of the nobles who\n      opposed <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  Slender\n      and strong, he is the High Seat of House Baryn.  He was exiled from the\n      Palace except for official functions by Morgase after she took the Lion\n      Throne, but he invited himself back when <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> forced\n      <a href=\"#Gaebril\">Gaebril</a> out of town.  He was later exiled\n      again by <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>, though he has since thrown his lot in with\n      her.  He now advocates retaking Caemlyn from the Trollocs.\n      His sign is a wing and hammer.\n  "}]}
