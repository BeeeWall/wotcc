She has raven-black hair\n      winged with white, and is about a head taller than her husband\n      Davram, the Marshal-General of Saldaea.  She was\n      stabbed by a man while he was ransacking her tent, but she survived.\n      She and Davram rarely yell, but they have a very upfront method of\n      conversing with each other that often makes others somewhat\n      uncomfortable.  She did not approve of her daughter&apos;s marriage at first,\n      but was eventually convinced to accept it.  She insisted on training\n      Zarine (i.e., Faile) in the ways of court intrigue and\n      politics, which she hated.  However, Faile has come to realize that she\n      would be lost without her mother&apos;s instruction.  With\n      <a href=\"#Tenobia\">Tenobia</a> dead, Deira is now Queen of Saldaea and her husband\n      King, though they have refused the Crown until the battle is over,\n      deferring command to <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a> because of Davram&apos;s incident with\n      <a href=\"#Hessalam\">Hessalam</a>.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Faile\">t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Bashere\">Bashere, Davram t&apos;Ghaline</a>.\n  "}]}
