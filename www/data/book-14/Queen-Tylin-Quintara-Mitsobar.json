She was the\n      second from her House to sit on the throne&#x2014;this was the maximum\n      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell\n      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by\n      Merilille Ceandevin of the Gray Ajah.  She was\n      a widow, and did not plan to marry again.  She took an interest in\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat&apos;s usual tactic of\n      chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>.  The\n      two were lovers for some time; Mat thought she was a <i>very</i> fun\n      quarry.  When the Seanchan invaded her nation,\n      she cooperated with them out of necessity&#x2014;they let her keep her\n      position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne.\n      When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in\n      the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city,\n      and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain\n      her to escape.  While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the\n      <i>gholam</i> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to\n      it.  She was found by <a href=\"#Suroth\">Suroth</a>&apos;s people the next\n      morning, torn limb-from-limb.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Cauthon, Matrim</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Beslan\">Mitsobar, Beslan</a>.\n  "}]}
