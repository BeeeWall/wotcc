A square-faced man, he is dark for an Andorman.  During the\n      Succession, Jared&apos;s House opposed <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a>; after\n      she became Queen, he was only allowed into the Palace on state\n      occasions.  When <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> killed\n      <a href=\"#Gaebril\">Gaebril</a> and took control of Caemlyn until he\n      could find <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>, Jarid tried to make himself\n      fall into favor, thinking he could gain power with the new ruler.  He\n      and his wife have been exiled, and supported\n      Arymilla&apos;s claim to the Lion Throne.\n      He still supports Elenia&apos;s attempt to claim the throne for herself.\n      He is very honorable, almost too much so.  Since\n      Elayne&apos;s ascention to the Lion Throne, he has been the most troubling\n      holdout against her.  His hair has grown loyal through the months of\n      his exile.  He continually demands <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>&apos;s head, claiming\n      she and the rest of the Aes Sedai are responsible for the strange events\n      in the world.  His men are beginning to grow weary of providing their\n      support, realizing that no human could perpetrate the events they are\n      witnessing.  He has ten personal guards, who wear his symbol:  a golden\n      bear charging before a read spear.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Bayrd\">Bayrd</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Davies\">Davies</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Eri\">Eri</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Karam\">Karam</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morear\">Morear</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Rosse\">Rosse</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elenia\">Sarand, Elenia</a>.\n  "}]}
