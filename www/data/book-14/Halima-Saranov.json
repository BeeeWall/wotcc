She was actually\n      Delana&apos;s maid, but she lent her to Egwene at\n      night to help Egwene with her chronic headaches.\n      Halima was actually Aran&apos;gar, a reincarnated\n      Forsaken who channels <i>saidin</i> despite being female.\n      She was <i>causing</i> Egwene&apos;s headaches, and then making them subside,\n      in order to keep herself close to Egwene.\n      It worked&#x2014;she usually slept on a pallet in Egwene&apos;s tent.\n      She was stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a\n      perfect face and a full, firm bosom.  As she was posing as a poorly\n      educated serving girl, she formed her letters with the awkwardness of a\n      young child.  She had developed a fondness for low-cut bodices.
