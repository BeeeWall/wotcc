Elaida sent her to Ebou Dar to meet\n      with <a href=\"#Tylin\">Queen Tylin</a> of Altara.  When the Seanchan\n      invaded, she was captured and made <i>damane</i>.  She was subsequently\n      released by Mat, and travels with him and\n      Luca&apos;s show.  She looks as if she chews rocks; Mat thinks\n      she could win a staring contest with a post.  She has lost some of the\n      skittishness she acquired as a <i>damane</i>.  She claims she felt\n      &#x201C;uncomfortable&#x201D; in the Tower, so she began traveling with\n      Dragonsworn instead.\n  "}]}
