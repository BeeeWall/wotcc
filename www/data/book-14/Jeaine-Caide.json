She grew up in\n      Arad Doman.  She has coppery skin and a swan-like neck, and is fond of\n      thin, clinging dresses.  This figure and taste is similar to how\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane</a> acts, dresses, and looks, and is typical of a\n      Domani woman.  When in Tanchico, Jeaine tried to kill\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> with the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> that produces\n      balefire.  Liandrin refuses to believe that\n      she even <i>saw</i> Nynaeve there, much less attacked her.  Jeaine\n      attempted to disguise herself as <a href=\"#Cadsuane\">Cadsuane</a> to get past\n      <a href=\"#Thom\">Thom</a> into the Pit of Doom&#x2014;Thom acted like he was\n      convinced, then casually threw a knife at her, severing her spine.\n      He was contemptuous of her disguise&#x2014;her gait was all wrong.  She\n      was the fifth Aes Sedai that Thom killed.\n\n\n  "}]}
