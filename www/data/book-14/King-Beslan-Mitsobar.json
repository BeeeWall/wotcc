{"id":"King-Beslan-Mitsobar","name":"King Beslan Mitsobar","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 11:  Just Another Sell-Sword","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Beslan\">King Beslan Mitsobar</a>,\n      p. 246&#x2014;King of Altara, and son of the late\n      <a href=\"#Tylin\">Queen Tylin</a>.  He is mild-mannered, has olive skin,\n      a soft voice, sharp eyes, and black hair to his shoulders.\n      He was of course a puppet of the Seanchan government while acting as\n      king of Altara, but it <i>did</i> make him the\n      equal of <a href=\"#Suroth\">Suroth</a> under the law.\n      He was secretly plotting a resistance to the Seanchan,\n      but changed his loyalties when confronted with the choice of loyalty or\n      death.  His head is now shaven, in the manner of the Blood, leaving only\n      a dark strip on top.  Seven of his fingernails are lacquered, one more\n      than anyone this side of the Aryth Ocean with the exception of\n      <a href=\"#Fortuona\">Fortuona</a> herself.  Beslan has not plotted against her since\n      their last confrontation, which surprises Fortuona&#x2014;<i>all</i> of\n      her rivals in Seanchan would have plotted against her given the same\n      circumstances.\n  "}]}
