He was a Warder at one time, bonded\n      to Rina Hafden, and left the Tower when he discoverd\n      that he could talk to wolves.  He did not find any problem with the\n      ability by itself, but felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who\n      thought they should gentle him (even though there was nothing to be\n      gentled) because of his ability.  Elyas helped\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> learn that he could talk to wolves as well;\n      Perrin did not necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over the\n      dislike of it as well.  The wolves call him\n      <a href=\"#Long\">Long Tooth</a>.  Compared to him, Aiel are noisy when\n      they are trying not to be heard.  Unlike Perrin, he generally avoids\n      the World of Dreams, what Perrin calls the Wolf Dream, though he lets\n      himself be drawn there when needed.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Long\">Long Tooth</a>.\n  "}]}
