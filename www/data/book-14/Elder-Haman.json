Loial was not there, and they were not able\n      to catch up with him for quite some time.  Loial intentionally skipped\n      Stedding Shantai on his trips to the <i>stedding</i> so as to avoid\n      Haman and his mother.  He is a prominent Speaker, and Loial&apos;s favorite\n      role model.  Haman is over three hundred years old.\n  "}]}
