He is <i>Shae&apos;en M&apos;taal</i>, a Stone Dog.\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> rescued him from his entrapment in Remen,\n      and Gaul now walks at Perrin&apos;s side during battle and elsewhere.\n      He tells Perrin that he followed him initially because Perrin saved his\n      life, but he stays for other reasons (presumably because he finds\n      Perrin to be an honorable leader).\n      Gaul wants to marry <a href=\"#Chiad\">Chiad</a>, but though she would agree to\n      become his lover, she will not give up the spear for him.  Once the\n      Shaido captured her, Gaul became truly dedicated to\n      recapturing her and bringing her back to him.\n      He killed at least a dozen Aiel warriors to get to Chiad;\n      he was somewhat disappointed to learn that <a href=\"#Bain\">Bain</a> was\n      <i>gai&apos;shain</i> to one of them as well.\n      Gaul has said he would consider accepting Bain as a wife just to get\n      Chiad&apos;s bridal wreath, though he is not excited about the prospect.\n      Since both Chiad <i>and</i> Bain are now <i>gai&apos;shain</i> to Gaul for\n      many months more, they have been using every opportunity to tease Gaul,\n      from washing his undergarments to sharpening spears for him.\n      Only a blind fool would believe Chiad does not share Gaul&apos;s feelings.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Chiad\">Chiad</a>.\n  "}]}
