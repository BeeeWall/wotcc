His talent for\n      Traveling is almost beyond belief: he can make gateways <i>much</i>\n      larger than he should be able to make, given his strength.  He has a\n      faint Taraboner accent.

He and Pevara have developed a\n      rapport of sorts.\n      Androl&apos;s past is varied, and unclear&#x2014;he seems to have held several\n      vocations, perhaps looking for one in which he felt he actually\n      belonged.

Androl later realized that his\n      father could channel, and was going mad from the taint&#x2014;his\n      family business, that of mining, was a bit too successful, as his father\n      just seemed to <i>know</i> where every rich vein of ore was.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Desartin\">Desartin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Sayer\">Sayer</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.\n  "}]}
