He is described by those who serve\n      the Shadow and know what he is as, &#x201C;the man with two souls.&#x201D;\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> once hunted him, chasing him through\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> all the way to the Tower of Ghenjei.\n      He did not see much of him for months afterward,\n      though Slayer has been busy again in recent weeks:\n      he enjoys killing wolves, considering them good sport.\n      The Shadow uses his ability to enter and leave the World of Dreams at\n      will to assassinate people thought important to the Light&apos;s cause.  He\n      once tried to kill <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> and <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> in their sleep,\n      though he had the wrong room.  Slayer is <a href=\"#Isam\">Isam</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s cousin, and his other soul is <a href=\"#Luc\">Luc</a>, whose\n      form he seems to prefer in the real world.  Luc is Rand&apos;s uncle, which\n      Luc is aware of but Rand is not.  The wolves describe his scent as\n      &#x201C;inhuman,&#x201D; like a man mixed with stone.\n      Slayer, in Isam&apos;s form, is muscular and tanned, with thick arms,\n      dark hair, and blue eyes.  He closely resembles Lan, his face all angles\n      and sharp lines.  Slayer, as Isam, enjoys the hunt.  Slayer, as Luc,\n      is more accommodating.  Slayer, as either soul, hates Perrin with a\n      rabid passion.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Luc\">Mantear, Luc</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
