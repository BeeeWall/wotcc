He has been missing since\n      before <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> killed <a href=\"#Sammael\">Sammael</a>.\n      He had no real power anyway, since Sammael ruled Illian from the Council\n      of Nine.  He was good-looking when he was younger, but he has not aged\n      well.  His beard is white, much of his hair has fallen out, his nose\n      looks like it has been broken more than once, and his face is crushed.\n      The cause of his disappearance has now been revealed:  he was kidnapped\n      and whisked out of Illian by <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>.  He remains a guest in\n      the Tower.\n  "}]}
