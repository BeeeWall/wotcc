He is bald with a fringe\n      of white hair around the edge of his head.  He was in the Queen&apos;s Guards\n      until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired\n      to help people with injuries.  He came for the amnesty to see if he\n      could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has\n      developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of\n      Legends.  He managed partially to Heal <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>&apos;s wound\n      in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does\n      not seep into it anymore.  Since he was placed on\n      <a href=\"#Taim\">Taim</a>&apos;s Traitors&apos; List, he had been in\n      hiding&#x2014;he did not assist in the attack on\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, but Rand thought it better to be safe than to\n      have him killed.  He has since been bonded as Warder to\n      Corele, and attempted to teach\n      Samitsu to do with <i>saidar</i> what he\n      does with <i>saidin</i>.  He was one of only three full Asha&apos;man to\n      travel with <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> in Tear.  Rand trusts him, and hopes to go\n      to him some day to learn Healing.\n  "}]}
