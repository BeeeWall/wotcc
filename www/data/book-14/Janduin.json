He was the youngest clan\n      chief of the Taardad Aiel in memory.  He ended the blood feud between\n      the Taardad and Nakai clans after over 200 years of fighting, and then\n      allied not only with the Nakai, but with the Reyn Aiel as well (who were\n      not much better than blood enemies before the alliance was made).  He\n      almost ended the blood feud between the Shaarad and Goshien clans (which\n      still existed until only a short time ago, causing trouble for\n      <a href=\"#Chiad\">Chiad</a> and <a href=\"#Gaul\">Gaul</a>), and would have\n      if <a href=\"#Laman\">King Laman</a> would not have cut down\n      <i>Avendoraldera</i>.\n      He loved Shaiel, to the\n      point where he could not refuse to let her fight in the Aiel War despite\n      being with child.  It was Janduin himself who led the four clans;\n      Taardad, Nakai, Reyn, and Shaarad; across the Spine of the World to\n      punish Laman for his Sin, throwing the entire World into war and\n      allowing Prophecy to be fulfilled.  The fact that Rand never knew\n      Janduin lends Rand hope for his own children.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Damodred, Tigraine</a>.\n  "}]}
