Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,\n      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had\n      the ability to channel inborn.  Her spears were melted down into other\n      objects, which themselves could not be weapons, to be given away as\n      gifts to the people she hated most&#x2014;the metal from one spear is\n      now used in a belt buckle for <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>.\n      She has green eyes, and is of age with Rand and <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>.\n      She is more than pretty with dark reddish hair.\n      Aviendha is one of the three women\n      in <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewing of Rand&#x2014;she also saw that\n      she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings\n      in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the\n      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became\n      unavailable and she tried bathing as &#x201C;wetlanders&#x201D; did; Rand\n      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she\n      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she\n      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,\n      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could\n      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the\n      night in each other&apos;s arms before coming back.  Aviendha sais a similar\n      incident would not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about\n      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of\n      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She\n      felt <i>toh</i> toward <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> for violating her\n      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her\n      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once\n      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second</i>\n      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has\n      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the\n      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is\n      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.\n      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&#x2014;a feat which\n      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She\n      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a\n      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely\n      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one\n      could do so without her knowing it immediately.\n      While Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn,\n      she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training.\n      While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent:  the ability to\n      sense the function of a <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> simply by holding it in her\n      hands.  Aviendha was very frustrated by the Wise Ones&apos; treatment of her\n      when she returned from her stay with Elayne; they seemed to be punishing\n      her for no reason she could ascertain, and continually asked her opinion\n      of matters as if to test her responses.  It turned out that this was the\n      last part of her training to become a Wise One:  she must tell the Wise\n      Ones she is one of them, or at least demand to be treated as an equal by\n      them.  They were pushing her harder and faster than they typically push\n      apprentices because they had no time:  she was needed at the Last\n      Battle, and they had no time to wait for her to become ready on her own.\n      She later went to Rhuidean, going through the crystal columns that are\n      the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> of Aiel history.  She expected she knew what she\n      will find there, and was not looking forward to watching what she\n      perceived to be the failure of her people.  She was correct:  she knew\n      what she would see.  Almost by accident, she entered the columns a\n      second time, witnessing events she could only identify as being from the\n      future:  the lives of her four children, an Aiel&#x2013;Seanchan war,\n      and the gradual destruction of the Aiel as a people.  She was horrified\n      by her vision, and is determined to change <i>something</i> in it, just\n      to prove to herself that the future is not pre-determined.  She knew her\n      visions would be met with confusion, but not the unpleasant silence that\n      has actually resulted.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>.\n  "}]}
