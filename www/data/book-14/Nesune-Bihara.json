She is slender, has black eyes, and grew up in\n      Kandor.  <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> had a viewing of her:  she will found a\n      library.  She was later one of <a href=\"#Cadsuane\">Cadsuane</a>&apos;s\n      companions.  She is one of a handful of people to ever be able to ignore\n      Cadsuane.
