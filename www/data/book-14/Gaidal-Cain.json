{"id":"Gaidal-Cain","name":"Gaidal Cain","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 12:  A Shard of a Moment","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Gaidal\">Gaidal Cain</a>,\n      p. 260&#x2014;Hero of\n      Legend bound to the Horn of Valere.  He is a swordsman, and is always\n      linked to <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a> in the stories.  Unlike his\n      depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as Birgitte is\n      beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> has ever seen.  Just being around him\n      made Nynaeve uncomfortable.  He and Birgitte are no longer tied to each\n      other thanks to <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>&apos;s tearing Birgitte\n      away from <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, and she fears she will never meet\n      Gaidal Cain again.  However, <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewings of\n      Birgitte indicate that she has spent and will spend lifetimes with the\n      same man&#x2014;though in some versions he is much older than she, and in\n      others he is <i>much</i> younger&#x2014;so it appears she will find her\n      lover again.  According to Birgitte, Gaidal always liked rain.  Before\n      being torn out, Birgitte had not seen Gaidal Cain for some time,\n      indicating he has been spun out and inhabits the body of a young boy\n      somewhere.  Birgitte currently does not remember him at all, though she\n      feels as though she <i>should</i> remember someone by that name.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>.\n  "}]}
