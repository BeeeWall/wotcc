She has gray-streaked golden hair.  She left Caemlyn with\n      Reanne days before\n      Arymilla&apos;s army appeared.  She became High Seat\n      of her house at age fifteen when her father died in a skirmish on the\n      Altaran Marches.  Elayne has admitted on several occasions that Dyelin\n      would probably make a very capable Queen of Andor.  Fortunately for\n      Elayne, she has no desire whatsoever to attain the Throne.  Unlike\n      <a href=\"#Lir\">Lord Lir</a>, she realizes that Caemlyn is lost.\n  "}]}
