He is <i>ta&apos;veren</i>.  When\n      he and <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the\n      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named\n      <a href=\"#Elyas\">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he\n      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in\n      himself.  Perrin&apos;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&apos; eyes, and\n      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a\n      childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&apos;veren</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On\n      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of\n      Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who\n      took the name of <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a> (which means\n      &#x201C;Falcon&#x201D; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a\n      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large\n      man&#x2014;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very\n      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other\n      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helped considerably\n      when helping <a href=\"#Luhhan\">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but\n      that combined with his careful nature sometimes gave others the\n      impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the Two Rivers\n      for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks;\n      he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the\n      first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he\n      returned, he began to draw the eye of\n      <a href=\"#Berelain\">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</a>,\n      the First of Mayene&#x2014;Perrin wants nothing more\n      than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no\n      for an answer, much to Faile&apos;s dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was\n      instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai&apos;s Wells; the\n      two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to\n      leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as\n      it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame\n      <a href=\"#Masema\">Masema</a>.  On the way, his wife was captured by\n      Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down.\n      He eventually formed an alliance with\n      <a href=\"#Khirgan\">Tylee Khirgan</a>, a Seanchan Banner-General,\n      to help him defeat the Shaido and free his wife.\n      Despite his strong desires to avoid both combat and lordship,\n      Perrin has become a very good general and leader.\n      Perrin witnessed Rand&apos;s internal battle on Dragonmount&apos;s summit.\n      He has also been trained by the wolves in manipulating Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod;\n      his skills have allowed him to fight Slayer, protecting wolves and\n      humans alike in the process, though not without casualties&#x2014;Hopper\n      himself was killed in the process.  Perrin has become strong enough in\n      Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod to halt a stream of balefire in its path&#x2014;in so\n      doing, he impressed upon Egwene that <i>nothing</i> is beyond the power\n      of a strong enough mind in the World of Dreams, leading her to defeat\n      the a&apos;dam Mesaana later placed on her and breaking Mesaana&apos;s\n      mind in the process.  Perrin has since come to terms with the wolf in\n      him, realizing now that he can reach the balance between man and wolf\n      that is right for him.  The only thing that throws him off is love for\n      Faile, but he now has realized that <i>she</i> is his link to his human\n      side if he ever forgets.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Faile\">t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Bull\">Bull, Young</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Cauthon, Matrim</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Hopper\">Hopper</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elyas\">Machera, Elyas</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Slayer\">Slayer</a>.\n  "}]}
