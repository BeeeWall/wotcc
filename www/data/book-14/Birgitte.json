{"id":"Birgitte","name":"Birgitte","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1:  Eastward the Wind Blew","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>,\n      p. 83&#x2014;Hero of Legend, bound to the Horn of Valere until\n      <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a> ripped her away.  She has long blonde\n      hair that she keeps in a braid, and is one of the best with bow and\n      arrows in all of human history.  During <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>&apos;s\n      struggle with Moghedien, Birgitte was ripped out of\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> and almost died.  She would have if she had not\n      been saved by <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>, who bonded her as a Warder\n      to give her the strength and quick healing she needed to survive.  She\n      is always linked to <a href=\"#Gaidal\">Gaidal Cain</a> in the stories,\n      and misses him immensely since he was spun out normally while she was\n      ripped out.  She lived four lives between the founding of the White\n      Tower and the Trolloc Wars, one of which involved her and Gaidal Cain\n      <i>helping</i> to found the Tower.  She is slowly forgetting the details\n      of those lives, which terrifies her.  She has lived as a soldier, a\n      forest woman, a general, a guard, a noble thief, a lady, a peasant, a\n      killer, and a savior.  This is, however, the first time she has been a\n      Warder.  She is nothing like the stories say she is supposed\n      to be like, except that she <i>is</i> pretty.\n      Her bond with Elayne appears to be different than most Warder bonds,\n      possibly because Elayne and Birgitte are both women; they mirror each\n      other&apos;s moods more, synchronize their cycles, and in general are linked\n      more strongly to each other than most Warders to their Aes Sedai.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Gaidal\">Cain, Gaidal</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>.\n  "}]}
