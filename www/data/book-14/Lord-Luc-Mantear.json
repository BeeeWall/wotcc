{"id":"Lord-Luc-Mantear","name":"Lord Luc Mantear","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  By Grace and Banners Fallen","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Luc\">Lord Luc Mantear</a>,\n      p. 26&#x2014;Son of\n      Queen Mordrellen of Andor and\n      brother to <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Tigraine</a>.\n      Gitara Moroso, then advisor to the Queen,\n      told him that his fame&#x2014;or his\n      fate&#x2014;lay in the Great Blight.  He disappeared from Andor into the\n      Blight shortly before <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Tigraine</a> disappeared, and\n      was never seen again.  Luc&apos;s soul in fact was merged with the soul of\n      <a href=\"#Isam\">Isam Mandragoran</a>, <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s cousin,\n      who disappeared into the Blight at about the same time.  Luc/Isam now\n      roams <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> as a unified entity that can change back\n      and forth between the two identities readily.  The combined entity now\n      serves as an assassin for the Shadow, whom the wolves call\n      <a href=\"#Slayer\">Slayer</a>.  It was Luc who killed the Gray\n      Man that <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> and <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>\n      stumbled upon in the Tower.  He may also have killed\n      Herid Fel.\n      Luc is aware that <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> is his nephew.\n      He bears a deep loathing for <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a>, who foiled his plans in\n      the Two Rivers and nearly killed him.  Luc is usually more accommodating\n      than his alter ego, Isam, but not when it comes to Perrin.\n      <a href=\"#Gaul\">Gaul</a> compares Luc to a <i>lopinginny</i>, a bird from the\n      Waste:  he talks big, but is actually a coward.  He went to the Blight\n      wanting to become part of something important.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Isam\">Mandragoran, Isam</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Slayer\">Slayer</a>.\n  "}]}
