He is an enigma; he arrived one day with <a href=\"#Logain\">Logain</a>,\n      saying nothing of his past.  He is distinguished, with a poised\n      bearing and a delicate way of speaking.  He is almost certainly nobly\n      born, though he makes no attempt to assert his presumed authority.\n      He took to life in the Black Tower immediately.  He is strong in the\n      One Power, almost as strong as <a href=\"#Nalaam\">Nalaam</a>, and has yet to reach\n      his full strength.  <a href=\"#Androl\">Androl</a> trusts him.  Emarin is actually\n      <a href=\"#Algarin\">Lord Algarin Pendaloan</a>, a lesser Lord of the\n      Land of Tear.  He took his younger brother Emarin&apos;s name\n      to conceal his identity.  The real Emarin was captured by\n      <a href=\"#Cadsuane\">Cadsuane</a> and gentled, though he survived for at least ten\n      years afterward.  Algarin was very grateful to her for helping him to\n      survive as long as he did after being severed.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Canler\">Canler</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Algarin\">Pendaloan, Algarin</a>.\n  "}]}
