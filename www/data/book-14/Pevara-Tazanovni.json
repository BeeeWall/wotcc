She grew up the niece of a Kandori leathermaker.\n      She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump, but\n      tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly say that Warders\n      would make a Red sister&apos;s job easier.  She and her friend since\n      novicehood, <a href=\"#Seaine\">Seaine</a>, began the hunt for Darkfriends\n      in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends,\n      but because Seaine&apos;s family was killed by Darkfriends when she was\n      young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved\n      being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be\n      able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family\n      and others like them.  She led the organization of sisters in the\n      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with\n      <a href=\"#Saerin\">Saerin Sedai</a>, who seized control away from\n      Seaine as soon as she knew what they were about.\n      Pevara mysteriously disappeared from the Tower&#x2014;in reality,\n      she was one of the sisters leading the embassy of sorts to the Black\n      Tower in which Red sisters offered to bond Asha&apos;man as Warders.\n      Pevara is still at the Black Tower, a virtual prisoner to Darkfriends\n      there.  Her seat in the Hall has been filled by another sister,\n      either permanently or until she returns.  She has developed a friendship\n      of sorts with <a href=\"#Androl\">Androl Genhald</a>, one of the\n      Dedicated.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Saerin\">Asnobar, Saerin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Seaine\">Herimon, Seaine</a>.\n  "}]}
