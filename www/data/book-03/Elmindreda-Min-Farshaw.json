She\n      dresses in men&apos;s clothing, a habit she picked up while\n      assisting her father in his mine.  She has dark eyes and dark\n      hair.  She has a special talent, that of seeing images or auras\n      around people that predict their futures.  Min does not think the\n      ability is all that great, since her viewings often forecast\n      death, pain, or other unpleasant circumstances for those they\n      represent.  One of her viewings surprised her:  she is destined\n      to fall in love with <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, but is\n      also destined to &#x201C;share&#x201D; him with two other women.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>.\n  "}]}
