Perrin is a large man,\n      and very cautious&#x2014;he\n      found it was easy to forget how big he was and really hurt other\n      children when he was young, so he is careful not to act too quickly.\n      He discovered that he can talk to wolves while he and\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> were separated from the rest of the\n      group between Aridhol and Caemlyn, when he encountered\n      <a href=\"#Elyas\">Elyas Machera</a>.
