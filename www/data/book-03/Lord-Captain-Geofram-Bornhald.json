Despite this, he may have been one of the few Whitecloaks who\n      saw beyond the propaganda of the Children, using his own wisdom to judge\n      people instead of insisting everyone not in white cloaks was in league\n      with the Shadow.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Dain\">Bornhald, Dain</a>.\n  "}]}
