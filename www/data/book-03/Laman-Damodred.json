This act, known as Laman&apos;s Sin,\n      prompted three clans of the Aiel to cross the Spine of the World and\n      avenge the death of the tree by taking his life.  The tree had been a\n      gift from the Aiel in gratitude for the hospitality the people of\n      Cairhien had displayed to them in the past.  It is unknown whether\n      Laman knew of the significance of <i>Avendoraldera</i>, or of the\n      reason the Aiel allowed the people of his kingdom to cross the Waste.\n      The fact that he cut the tree down and brought the Aiel over the\n      Dragonwall allowed Prophesy to be fulfilled and the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a> to\n      be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of the ancient blood (Aiel)\n      and raised by the old (Manetheren).
