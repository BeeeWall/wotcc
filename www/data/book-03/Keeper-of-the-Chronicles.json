The Keeper is traditionally chosen\n      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the\n      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post\n      is currenlty held by <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah.\n      In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin Seat\n      and speaks for the Amyrlin Seat; she is all but separate from her Ajah,\n      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Beldeine\">Nyram, Beldeine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Sharif, Leane</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
