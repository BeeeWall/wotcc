When\n      Egeanin found her, she tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the\n      <i>a&apos;dam</i> she was carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one\n      more barrier to the woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot\n      channel, the <i>a&apos;dam</i> should have no other effect than throwing a\n      metal ring around her head).  Much to Egeanin&apos;s surprise, the\n      <i>a&apos;dam</i> held Bethamin just as well as it held the <i>damane</i> it\n      was intended for.  Bethamin already knew this, from observing\n      Renna, who <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> left collared after Falme.\n      From this, and from <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>&apos;s and\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>&apos;s information about the possibility of\n      learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that\n      all <i>sul&apos;dam</i>, including Bethamin, could channel if they were\n      taught&#x2014;which went against everything she had been taught her\n      entire life.  Bethamin is now forbidden to be linked to <i>damane</i>,\n      both as protection for her&#x2014;if anyone besides\n      <a href=\"#Suroth\">Suroth</a> knew that the <i>a&apos;dam</i> would control\n      her, they would probably make her wear it all the time&#x2014;and as\n      protection for the Seanchan way of life, which would likely collapse if\n      it was learned that <i>sul&apos;dam</i> could channel just as well as\n      <i>damane</i>.  She has since been spirited away from Ebou Dar\n      with <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>, Egeanin, and the rest of the group that\n      fled Ebou Dar.\n  "}]}
