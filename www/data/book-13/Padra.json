She and her siblings have\n      been able to channel since they were children, even though the ability\n      usually only manifests at adolescence.  She is convinced that no living\n      person understands the One Power the way she and her siblings do; all\n      others who can channel seem awkward by comparison.  She is a Maiden of\n      the Spear as well.  She can weave gateways without thinking, and holds\n      the One Power perpetually, even when asleep.  She and her siblings have\n      elevated status amoung the Aiel, which is why she is allowed to be a\n      Maiden despite being able to channel.  The four of them are\n      quadruplets, but nonetheless look <i>very</i> dissimilar.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Alarch\">Alarch</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Janduin2\">Janduin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Marinna\">Marinna</a>.\n  "}]}
