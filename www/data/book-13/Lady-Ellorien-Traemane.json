Morgase exiled her from Caemlyn as per\n      <a href=\"#Gaebril\">Gaebril</a>&apos;s suggestion; when Ellorien demanded to\n      know why, Morgase had her flogged.  <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> was\n      named after her grandmother.  Morgase hopes she will forgive her for\n      what she did and support her when she comes to Andor to reclaim her\n      throne, or at least support <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> in her claim.\n      She and her House have effectively disappeared from the face of Andoran\n      politics for the last few weeks.\n      Morgase remembers exiling her, but she does not remember <i>why</i>\n      she exiled her.  She has been the most problematic holdout against\n      Elayne, except perhaps for <a href=\"#Jarid\">Jarid Sarand</a>.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Gaebril\">Gaebril</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Jarid\">Sarand, Jarid</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
