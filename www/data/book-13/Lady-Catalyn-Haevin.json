She is a dark-eyed young woman, though barely\n      more than a girl.  She pledged the support of her House to\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.  She is very presumptuous and snooty,\n      especially for someone who had not even heard of\n      Gareth Bryne (Elayne claims that miners in Baerlon\n      had heard Lord Bryne&apos;s name).  She is somewhat plump, and <em>very</em>\n      proud; Elayne considers her to be ungovernable.  Her sign is a blue\n      bear.  She was invited to the opera <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> had performed in\n      the Palace.\n  "}]}
