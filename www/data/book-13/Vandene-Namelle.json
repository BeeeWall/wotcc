They were both summoned back\n      early, however, and they later came to Salidar to escape\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>&apos;s summons back to the Tower.  Vandene went with\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> to Caemlyn, and dedicated nearly all of her waking\n      hours to tracking down Adeleas&apos;s murderess.  She found her when she,\n      Elayne, <a href=\"#Sareitha\">Sareitha</a>, and <a href=\"#Careane\">Careane</a> were captured by\n      the Black Ajah:  Careane was named &#x201C;one of us&#x201D; by one of\n      the Black sisters.  Vandene immediately plunged her dagger into\n      Careane&apos;s heart, but did not survive her long:  <a href=\"#Chesmal\">Chesmal</a>\n      touched her and Sareitha with a weave Elayne had never seen before, and\n      they both collapsed as if made of cloth.\n      She was slender, and had white hair.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Adeleas\">Namelle, Adeleas</a>.\n  "}]}
