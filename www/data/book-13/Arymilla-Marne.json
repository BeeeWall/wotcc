She\n      opposed <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  The only\n      real reason <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> kept her around in Caemlyn was to\n      push others into supporting <a href=\"#Dyelin\">Dyelin</a>; no one wanted\n      Andor in the hands of Arymilla.  Once <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>\n      returned to Andor, she exiled Arymilla as her mother had.  However,\n      Arymilla learned of where <a href=\"#Naean\">Naean</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Elenia\">Elenia</a> were being detained in Murandy and rescued\n      them.  This debt of sorts bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support\n      Arymilla&apos;s claim to the Lion Throne.  She had the support of five\n      major houses of Andor at one point.  She is plump, verging on stout,\n      has a vacuous smile, and brown eyes that are almost always wide with\n      interest.  After her failed attempt to take the Throne, Elayne had her\n      imprisoned; she is still plump despite her captivity.  She might even\n      be pretty if not for the rags she now wears.\n      Her sign is four silver moons on a twilight blue field.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Naean\">Arawn, Naean</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elenia\">Sarand, Elenia</a>.\n  "}]}
