She\n      is tall, and has long black hair in a braid.  She has been convinced\n      that she can learn to channel, and now asserts that she must be\n      collared.  The Aes Sedai working with her think she is determined to\n      learn the weaves only so she can do something dangerous, thus providing\n      evidence that she <i>needs</i> to be collared.  They keep some forkroot\n      in her at all times these days, just to be sure.  She claims that it is\n      <i>impossible</i> that <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a> took the bloodknife off of a\n      living Bloodknife; she reasons that if he fought a Bloodknife, he would\n      be dead.  Her knowledge of them convinces Gawyn that the Tower is in\n      danger from the remaining Seanchan assassins.\n\n\n  "}]}
