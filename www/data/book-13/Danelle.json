She is young, but is nonetheless\n      the typical Brown, often slight and seemingly lost in her own\n      thoughts.  She has no friends, even among the Browns, preferring to\n      keep to herself.  Perhaps because of this tendency, <a href=\"#Mesaana\">Mesaana</a>\n      killed her and used her identity to conceal herself inside the Tower.\n      It is not known whether Danelle was already dead and her identity stolen\n      when Siuan was deposed, or whether Danelle did that particular action on\n      her own.  Based on the timeline, she was likely replaced <i>before</i>\n      the Tower broke.\n  "}]}
