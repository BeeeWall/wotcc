Aran&apos;gar was\n      the right-hand dagger in a form of dueling popular right after the\n      creation of the Bore.  The sport fell from common practice, since almost\n      invariably both duelists died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The\n      other Forsaken consider Balthamel&apos;s new body a fine joke; the soul of\n      Balthamel now occupies the body of a beautiful young woman.  She still\n      channels <i>saidin</i>, and now serves as <a href=\"#Delana\">Delana</a>&apos;s\n      maid.  Delana does not know that she is one of the Chosen reincarned,\n      just that she stands far above her among the Darkfriends.  Aran&apos;gar, as\n      Balthamel, specialized in primitive cultures.\n      Aran&apos;gar&apos;s cover was blown when she tried to touch the ward against\n      eavesdropping around the meeting of the Hall of the Tower in exile,\n      at which time <a href=\"#Romanda\">Romanda Cassin</a> deduced that she and\n      Delana were Darkfriends.  She has since been hiding, along with\n      Delana, at <a href=\"#Natrin\">Natrin</a>&apos;s Barrow with <a href=\"#Graendal\">Graendal</a>.\n      She was killed by <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> with the giant weave of balefire he\n      used to destroy Natrin&apos;s Barrow.  Her death meant the Compulsion that\n      Graendal asked her and Delana to implant on\n      <a href=\"#Ramshalan\">Lord Ramshalan</a>&apos;s mind vanished&#x2014;Rand\n      thought Graendal herself had implanted the Compulsion, so Graendal\n      shielded Aran&apos;gar so she could not escape.  Aran&apos;gar is now <i>very</i>\n      dead, as is Delana.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Delana\">Mosalaine, Delana</a>.\n  "}]}
