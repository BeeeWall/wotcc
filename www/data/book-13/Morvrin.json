She is stout, and has graying hair. She is one of the\n      six sisters who controlled much of the action in Salidar, despite not\n      being part of the Hall of the Tower.  She is taller than her Warder,\n      Jori, has a round placid face, and plump hands.  She\n      believes in a blending of common sense and logic, which makes her very\n      hard-headed and suspicious of quick or easy solutions.\n  "}]}
