She is tall for a Cairhienin\n      woman (and <i>only</i> for a Cairhienin woman&amp;hellp;).  She had pledged\n      for <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, but disappeared after the attack by Asha&apos;man.\n      The last Rand saw her, she was bound with the Power under a bed.  Since\n      Toram is assumed dead, she has assumed the High Seat of House\n      Riatin.  She is slim and middle-aged, and a vocal supporter of\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.\n  "}]}
