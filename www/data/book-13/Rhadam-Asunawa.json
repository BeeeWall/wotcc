He wants every woman affiliated in any way with the White Tower\n      hanged as of yesterday, every book that mentions Aes Sedai or the White\n      Tower burned, and the very words banned.

He commands\n      what Valda describes as an odd respect among the Children, even among\n      those who despise the Questioners.
