He is described by those who serve\n      the Shadow and know what he is as, &#x201C;the man with two souls.&#x201D;\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> once hunted him, chasing him through\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> all the way to the Tower of Ghenjei.\n      He has not seen much of him since, though Slayer has been busy again in\n      recent weeks:  he enjoys killing wolves, considering them good sport.\n      The Shadow uses his ability to enter and leave the World of Dreams at\n      will to assassinate people thought important to the Light&apos;s cause.  He\n      once tried to kill <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> and <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> in their sleep,\n      though he had the wrong room.  Slayer is <a href=\"#Isam\">Isam</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s cousin, and his other soul is <a href=\"#Luc\">Luc</a>, whose\n      form he seems to prefer in the real world.  Luc is Rand&apos;s uncle, which\n      Luc is aware of but Rand is not.  The wolves describe his scent as\n      &#x201C;inhuman,&#x201D; like a man mixed with stone.\n      Slayer, in Isam&apos;s form, is muscular and tanned, with thick arms,\n      dark hair, and blue eyes.  He closely resembles Lan, his face all angles\n      and sharp lines.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Chiendelna\">Chiendelna, Luc</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Luc\">Mantear, Luc</a>.\n  "}]}
