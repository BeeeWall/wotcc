He is old, with thin hair and\n      wrinkled eyes.  He has a short white beard that he keeps trimmed to a\n      point.  He is an enigma; he arrived one day with <a href=\"#Logain\">Logain</a>,\n      saying nothing of his past.  He is distinguished, with a poised\n      bearing and a delicate way of speaking.  He is almost certainly nobly\n      born.  He makes no attempt to assert his presumed authority.  He took\n      to life in the Black Tower immediately.  <i>Editor&apos;s note:  There is a\n      distinct possibility that this Emarin and\n      Emarin Pendaloan, Algarin&apos;s\n      younger brother, are the same person.  That Emarin was captured by\n      <a href=\"#Cadsuane\">Cadsuane</a> and gentled, though he survived for at least ten\n      years afterward.  Algarin seemed to think that Emarin was dead,\n      however.</i>\n  "}]}
