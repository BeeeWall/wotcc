He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to\n      see the world; by Ogier standards, he is not yet old enough to leave the\n      <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is\n      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is\n      writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he\n      meets, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>,\n      and <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>.\n      Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to\n      marry him off and settle him down; however,\n      he does like his mother&apos;s choice of wives for him,\n      Erith.  He, like most of the Ogier,\n      is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that\n      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.\n      Loial&apos;s mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now\n      married.  He is currently in Stedding Shangtai speaking to the Stump.\n      Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually be called\n      <i>The Dragon Reborn</i> and will catalog\n      everything he has been through with the three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> as well as\n      any details he has been able to pry out of them.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Arent\">Arent</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Covril\">Covril</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Halan\">Halan</a>.\n  "}]}
