She was weary-eyed and resigned the first day\n      <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a> met her, when she gave Faile her golden belt\n      signifying service to <a href=\"#Sevanna\">Sevanna</a>.  Her time as\n      <i>gai&apos;shain</i> toughened her a lot.  She was the one who took\n      Faile to see that <a href=\"#Arrela\">Arrela</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Lacile\">Lacile</a> had been captured, then led her to\n      Sevanna for her own punishment.  Before leaving her with Sevanna,\n      however, she swore fealty to Faile, using Faile&apos;s new last name.  She\n      knew Faile planned to escape, and wanted to help&#x2014;provided she\n      could escape as well.  She was once a noble, it appears.  She grew up\n      in Amadicia.  Her face is plump, but still haggard from her\n      captivity.  She acts as the unofficial Steward of\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> and Faile&apos;s camp.\n  "}]}
