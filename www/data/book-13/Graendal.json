She\n      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.\n      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized\n      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing\n      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her\n      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,\n      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of\n      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only\n      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their\n      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the\n      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important\n      figures.  With Sammael dead,\n      <a href=\"#Moridin\">Moridin</a> is the only person who knows how to find her.\n      Graendal has been allowed limited access to the True Power through\n      Moridin in recent days; she cannot take as much as she wants, but it is\n      enough to, for example, take possession of a dove&apos;s mind and see through\n      its eyes.  Unbeknownst to <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, Graendal <i>survived</i> his\n      attack on <a href=\"#Natrin\">Natrin</a>&apos;s Barrow.  Since he believes her dead, she\n      feels she can plot against him&#x2014;or someone else important to\n      him&#x2014;without anyone suspecting that she is involved.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Basene\">Basene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Kamarile\">Nindar, Kamarile Maradim</a>.\n  "}]}
