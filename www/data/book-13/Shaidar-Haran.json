He\n      is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who are the\n      height of an average man and all the same height.  His name means\n      &#x201C;Hand of the Dark&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal names\n      come from the Trolloc tongue.  He is given special consideration; the\n      ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head as it\n      does everyone else&apos;s.  He is the only known servant of the Dark One to\n      have power over the Chosen (other than <a href=\"#Moridin\">Moridin</a>,\n      who is one of the Chosen himself).\n      It was Shaidar Haran himself who freed <a href=\"#Semirhage\">Semirhage</a> from her\n      captivity; he may have set Semirhage up to be killed because the\n      Dark One (or perhaps Moridin) was displeased with her.\n\n\n  "}]}
