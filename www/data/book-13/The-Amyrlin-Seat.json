{"id":"The-Amyrlin-Seat","name":"The Amyrlin Seat","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 3:  The Amyrlin's Anger","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Amyrlin\">The Amyrlin Seat</a>,\n      p. 73&#x2014;The leader\n      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory\n      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower\n      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come\n      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip\n      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The\n      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in\n      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must\n      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be\n      &#x201C;of all Ajahs and none&#x201C;&#x2014;all previous affiliations with\n      Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly\n      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions.\n      No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since\n      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who\n      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in\n      <a href=\"#Hawkwing\">Artur Hawkwing</a>&apos;s day, except for\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, raised Amyrlin in Tar\n      Valon after a coup deposed <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>;\n      the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of\n      Amyrlins from its Ajah&#x2014;four of the last the last five Amyrlins\n      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to\n      the mean number of Amyrlins from one&apos;s Ajah have only added to the\n      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has\n      a secretary of sorts, the\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,\n      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the\n      Amyrlin was raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she\n      was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her successor was the leader of\n      the coup, <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida do Avriny a&apos;Roihan</a>, raised from\n      the Red Ajah.  Siuan&apos;s deposition divided the Tower, and the faction\n      opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of\n      choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, who was outside the Tower and not\n      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene\n      was Raised.  Other sisters outside the Tower, in many cases,\n      did not reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida.\n      Egwene was captured by forces loyal to Elaida during a partially\n      successful attempt to turn the harbor chains to <i>cuendillar</i>;\n      Elaida re-enlisted her as a Novice, and treated her as a disobedient,\n      stubborn child.  Egwene remained defiant to the very last, trying to\n      garner support from within.  Elaida stubbornly refused to acknowledge\n      Egwene&apos;s warnings of a Seanchan attack; that very attack, when it\n      occurred, claimed Elaida herself as a prisoner of the Seanchan.  After\n      two tense days, filled with revelations of the Black Ajah, the aftermath\n      of the Seanchan attack, and a near-invasion by Egwene&apos;s army, the Hall\n      Selected a new Amyrlin:  Egwene al&apos;Vere, raised from the Accepted (no\n      Ajah).\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>.\n  "}]}
