{"id":"Pedron-Niall","name":"Pedron Niall","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 6:  Questioning Intentions","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Niall\">Pedron Niall</a>,\n      p. 129&#x2014;Former Lord\n      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, highest officer among\n      the Children.  He was one of the great military commanders of the world,\n      in company with <a href=\"#Bashere\">Davram Bashere</a>,\n      Agelmar Jagad,\n      <a href=\"#Rodel\">Rodel Ituralde</a>, Gareth Bryne,\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>, and several Aiel chiefs.  He was trying\n      to get Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian so the Council of Nine\n      would not invade both countries.  He also tried to expand Amadicia&apos;s\n      borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His headquarters were in Amadicia, and\n      he ruled there even above King Ailron, although\n      this was not spoken of openly.  Niall once offered a treaty with\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor, offering Whitecloak\n      assistance to retake her throne in exchange for Whitecloak presence in\n      Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence that Morgase had not allowed\n      even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall was killed by his alleged\n      Spymaster, Abdel Omerna, who claimed he had gone\n      against everything the Children stood for by allowing Morgase to avoid\n      being put to the question.  He was replaced by\n      <a href=\"#Valda\">Eamon Valda</a>, who also killed Omerna.  Rumor puts\n      him dead in a duel or a skirmish though <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a> is\n      certain Valda himself is responsible in some fashion or another.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Balwer\">Balwer, Sebban</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Valda\">Valda, Eamon</a>.\n  "}]}
