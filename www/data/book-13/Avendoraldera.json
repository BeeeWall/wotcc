The\n      Cairhienin never knew exactly why the Aiel gave them such a gift, and\n      almost five hundred years later it was almost forgotten that it\n      <i>was</i> a gift from them.  The tree, which grew in the center of the\n      city of Cairhien, was cut down by\n      <a href=\"#Laman\">King Laman Damodred</a> twenty years ago,\n      which precipitated the Aiel War.  Four\n      clans of the Aiel crossed the Dragonwall under the leadership of\n      Janduin, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>&apos;s father and\n      chief of the Taardad Aiel, to punish Laman for his sin.  The deep\n      respect the Aiel held for the Cairhienin, as well as the passage\n      through the Waste they were allowed, was terminated after Laman&apos;s\n      Sin&#x2014;the Aiel now refer to all Cairhienin as\n      &#x201C;treekillers,&#x201D; and think nothing of killing or mistreating\n      them.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <i><a href=\"#Aven\">Avendesora</a></i>;\n      <a href=\"#Laman\">Damodred, Laman</a>.\n  "}]}
