He disappeared from Andor into the\n      Blight shortly before <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Tigraine</a> disappeared, and\n      was never seen again.  Luc&apos;s soul in fact was merged with the soul of\n      <a href=\"#Isam\">Isam Mandragoran</a>, <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s cousin,\n      who disappeared into the Blight at about the same time.  Luc/Isam now\n      roams <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> as a unified entity that can change back\n      and forth between the two identities readily.  The combined entity now\n      serves as an assassin for the Shadow, whom the wolves call\n      <a href=\"#Slayer\">Slayer</a>.  It was Luc who killed the Gray\n      Man that <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> and <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>\n      stumbled upon in the Tower.  He may also have killed\n      <a href=\"#Fel\">Herid Fel</a>.\n      Unlike pretty much everyone else,\n      Luc is aware that <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> is his nephew.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Chiendelna\">Chiendelna, Luc</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Isam\">Mandragoran, Isam</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Slayer\">Slayer</a>.\n  "}]}
