{"id":"Delana-Mosalaine","name":"Delana Mosalaine","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Distinctions","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Delana\">Delana Mosalaine</a>,\n      p. 26&#x2014;Aes\n      Sedai of the Black Ajah, openly a Sitter for the Gray Ajah in the\n      &#x201C;Little Tower.&#x201D;  She used to be the only Sitter that\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> thought she could count on for her support.\n      She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman and pale silver-colored\n      hair.  She is from Shienar, and has no Warder.  Delana started to cause\n      trouble in the Hall, especially with her demand to make a\n      formal declaration that <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> is Black Ajah.  She\n      was willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters\n      would not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her\n      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of\n      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named\n      Halima, and she often lent her to Egwene; Halima\n      was the only person who seemed to be able to make Egwene&apos;s headaches go\n      away.  Halima, of course, was <em>causing</em> Egwene&apos;s headaches, but\n      she was not aware of that.  Delana went pale and excused herself from\n      the Hall when <a href=\"#Narishma\">Narishma</a> reported that a woman was\n      able to channel <i>saidin</i> and then detected a someone attempting to\n      break through the ward against eavesdropping with <i>saidin</i>.\n      <a href=\"#Romanda\">Romanda</a> subsequently put two and two together,\n      and demanded Delana be arrested.  She and Halima had already left the\n      camp.  Delana was also on <a href=\"#Verin\">Verin</a>&apos;s list of Black sisters.\n      Since leaving the rebels, Delana has been in hiding at\n      <a href=\"#Natrin\">Natrin</a>&apos;s Barrow with <a href=\"#Arangar\">Aran&apos;gar</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Graendal\">Graendal</a>; according to Graendal, she and Aran&apos;gar are in a\n      relationship of sorts.  She was killed by Rand&apos;s massive balefire weave\n      that destroyed the Barrow and its inhabitants.\n  "}]}
