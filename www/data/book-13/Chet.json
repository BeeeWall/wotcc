There&apos;s a man like him in every\n      tavern in the world:  old enough to have seen men <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>&apos;s age\n      be born, grow up, and die, and willing to talk of all those years if\n      you got enough drink in them, and often if you did not.  The stubble on\n      his face is dappled silver, he wears a lopsided cap, his patched coat\n      had once been black, and the red-and-white insignia on his pocket is\n      too faded to read.  The insignia may be from some sort of military\n      service; the scars on his cheek and neck seem to support that idea.\n  "}]}
