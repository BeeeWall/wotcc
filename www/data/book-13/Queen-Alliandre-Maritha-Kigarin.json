She is the fourth person to sit on the throne of Ghealdan in the\n      past several months.  She wore jewelry to her meetings with\n      <a href=\"#Masema\">Masema</a> for the sole purpose of giving it to him\n      such that he would not ask for anything more; she also sent a letter\n      to <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> offering him her friendship and asking for\n      his help.  She was subsequently captured by the Shaido Aiel, and is now\n      one of <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a>&apos;s followers.
