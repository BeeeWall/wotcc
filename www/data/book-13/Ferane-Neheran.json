She stepped down from the Hall of the\n      Tower about ten years ago, but was recently re-appointed to the Hall\n      by the White Ajah; no sister has <i>ever</i> rejoined the Hall that\n      quickly.  She is the head of the White Ajah, its First Reasoner.  She\n      grew up in Arad Doman, and has the coppery skin (and temper) typical of\n      the Domani.  She is a touch on the vain side.\n      She is short and stout with an apple-shaped face, has a strong arm,\n      and dark, lustrous hair.\n\n\n  "}]}
