She disapproved of her\n      husband&apos;s decision to come for the amnesty, but lives with it.  She is\n      somehow connected to Jur by a bond that the Asha&apos;man believe is similar\n      to the bond between Warder and Aes Sedai.  She accepted Jur&apos;s decision\n      to become an Asha&apos;man because they thought he had little\n      choice&#x2014;his father could channel, and the Red Ajah found him\n      shortly after Jur was born.  He did not live long after they gentled\n      him.  Now that the taint is gone, he is anxious to tell Sora that they\n      can continue to live out their lives without fear that he will go\n      insane.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Gadren\">Grady, Gadren</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Grady\">Grady, Jur</a>.\n  "}]}
