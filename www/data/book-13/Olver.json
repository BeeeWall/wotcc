He\n      was adopted after a fashion by <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> and his Band of\n      the Red Hand.  His parents were killed when the Shaido ravaged Cairhien.\n      He is short, pale, and quite ugly.  He likes to chase women.  He is a\n      good horse racer, and travels with Mat.\n      He has a certain fascination with the game Snakes and Foxes, and\n      does not seem to understand that there is no way to win without\n      cheating.  Olver seems to think there <i>is</i> a way&#x2014;it just\n      involves being luckier than any average person would ever be.\n      <i>Note:  many people think that Olver may be the Rebirth of\n      <a href=\"#Gaidal\">Gaidal Cain</a>&#x2014;he is certainly ugly, as Gaidal\n      was, and with <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewing of\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>&apos;s adventures with an ugly man both far\n      older than she and far younger than she, it seems to fit.  Also, there\n      is speculation that Olver&apos;s obsession with Snakes and Foxes, which is\n      based on dealings with the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, will allow him (or Mat,\n      <a href=\"#Thom\">Thom</a>, or someone else who would observe his\n      solutions) to puzzle out how to beat the Eelfinn and get\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a> back from them.  Personally, I think Olver is a\n      red herring, at least on the first count.</i>\n  "}]}
