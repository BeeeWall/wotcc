He is a blocky man with broad\n      shoulders, and all his hair is now gray, though it used to be deep black\n      when Rand was a boy.  He has a calm manner.\n      He taught Rand about the\n      Flame and the Void, a trick he uses to concentrate and to win archery\n      competitions; Rand found that it is the way he can gain access to\n      <i>saidin</i>.  Tam is not actually Rand&apos;s biological father; he found\n      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with\n      him since Rand&apos;s mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the\n      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He\n      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster\n      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  In fact,\n      Demetre Marcolin served under him when he was a\n      Second Captain in the Companions.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,\n      Kari, who he met while stationed there.  When the\n      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle\n      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari\n      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions\n      (or came in second to Abell Cauthon), and passed\n      his archery skills on to Rand.  He also taught <a href=\"#Aram\">Aram</a>\n      how to use his sword.  Tam had no idea that the child\n      he was raising was the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.  He is\n      currently traveling with <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> and the rest of the troops\n      from the Two Rivers.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>.\n  "}]}
