He is a swordsman, and is always\n      linked to <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a> in the stories.  Unlike his\n      depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as Birgitte is\n      beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> has ever seen.  Just being around him\n      made Nynaeve uncomfortable.  He and Birgitte are no longer tied to each\n      other thanks to <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>&apos;s tearing Birgitte\n      away from <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, and she fears she will never meet\n      Gaidal Cain again.  However, <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewings of\n      Birgitte indicate that she has spent and will spend lifetimes with the\n      same man&#x2014;though in some versions he is much older than she, and in\n      others he is <i>much</i> younger&#x2014;so it appears she will find her\n      lover again.  According to Birgitte, Gaidal always liked rain.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>.\n  "}]}
