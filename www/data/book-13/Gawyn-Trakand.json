{"id":"Gawyn-Trakand","name":"Gawyn Trakand","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 3:  The Amyrlin's Anger","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Gawyn\">Gawyn Trakand</a>,\n      p. 73&#x2014;Son of\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother to\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword\n      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White\n      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now\n      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that\n      erupted after <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>&apos;s deposition, Gawyn\n      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders\n      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back\n      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself\n      killed <a href=\"#Hammar\">Hammar</a> and Coulin,\n      the men in charge of teaching the sword and\n      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were\n      Blademasters&#x2014;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn\n      managed to kill both of them.  When he learned more of what actually\n      happened, Gawyn did not know which party to support&#x2014;he believed\n      that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was\n      wrong, but at the same time he realized he did not know all the facts\n      surrounding the change in leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and\n      her friends <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene al&apos;Vere</a> side with those\n      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is\n      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>\n      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene\n      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside\n      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he\n      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no\n      telling how he will react when he finds out that Elayne actually does\n      love Rand (and is carrying his twins).\n      Gawyn led the Younglings on harrying parties against the\n      army besieging Tar Valon; Lord Bryne was quite upset\n      to find out that it was someone who had inside information about his\n      tactics that was harrying him so successfully.\n      At one time, Gawyn had no problem with the fact that he had killed his\n      former teachers&#x2014;they were rebelling against a lawfully raised\n      Amyrlin&#x2014;but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had\n      truly chosen the just side.  He has stated that he did not like\n      Elaida&#x2014;she had always been cold to him as his mother&apos;s\n      advisor&#x2014;but he supported her because he disliked what Siuan had\n      done, involving Egwene and Elayne in her plotting.  Eventually, he\n      learned that Egwene herself lead the rebels, and that she had been\n      captured.  He stubbornly refused to believe she could <i>possibly</i> be\n      safe as a prisoner, and vowed to do anything to rescue her.  He\n      eventually jumped at the chance to help Siuan mount a rescue; Egwene is\n      quite angry at him (and at Siuan) for disobeying her direct orders.\n      Gawyn is trying to discover what his relationship to Egwene needs to be\n      as her Warder, which of course he must do before she bonds him.  He is\n      finding that situation very trying&#x2014;he is used to being his own\n      person.  His sign is a white boar.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Damodred, Galadedrid</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
