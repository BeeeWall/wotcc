She is one of the two prettiest girls in the Accepted&apos;s\n      quarters, and she is very aware of that fact.  She always smiles when\n      looking in a mirror, and always seems to be near to a mirror when she\n      smiles.  Waves of golden hair frame her nearly perfect face, her eyes\n      look like large sapphires, and her skin is a rich creamy color.  The\n      only fault in her appearance, according to\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>, is an over-abundance of bosom.  She\n      is very tall, as tall as most men.  She is fond of telling everyone that\n      she wants to be a Green and have six Warders.  She has spiky\n      handwriting.\n\n\n  "}]}
