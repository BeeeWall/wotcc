This prison was bored into during the Age of\n      Legends; the Dark One&apos;s touch on the world produced new waves of hate,\n      crime, and violence that had never been seen before.  An attempt to free\n      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow, a war which\n      ended only with the sealing of the Bore by\n      Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.\n      During the moment of sealing, the Dark One&apos;s counterstroke tainted\n      <i>saidin</i> itself, beginning the Time of Madness.\n      The seals on the prison were made of <i>cuendillar</i>,\n      an indestructible substance, but nonetheless are beginning to weaken.\n      The Dark One may touch the world again soon.  Speaking his true name\n      draws his attention and causes bad luck, so he is known by a plethora of\n      euphemisms, most commonly as simply, &#x201C;The Dark One.&#x201D;  Some,\n      including <a href=\"#Bukama\">Bukama</a>, believe that merely\n      <i>thinking</i> his true name is enough.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Creator\">Creator, The</a>.\n  "}]}
