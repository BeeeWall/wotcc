He is very tall, with long hair\n      that he wears back with the <i>hadori</i>, a braided leather strap\n      traditionally worn by Malkieri men.  At his birth, shortly before the\n      Trollocs overran Malkier and the Blight consumed his homeland, Lan was\n      given four gifts (while still in his cradle): a gold signet ring, a\n      locket, a sword, and an oath. Lan and his surviving Malkieri companions\n      are the last of their people. He prefers to avoid Aes Sedai when\n      possible.  Lan has experience fighting the Aiel on the\n      Shienaran Marches, long before the Aiel War even began.  He is quite\n      practiced in the <i>ko&apos;di</i>, the Oneness, a concentration aid he uses\n      to clear his mind for battle and other crucial situations.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Akir\">Mandragoran, Akir</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Leanna\">ti Mandragoran, Leanna</a>.\n  "}]}
