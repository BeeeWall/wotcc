Traditionally, a newly raised Amyrlin grants indulgences and\n      relief from penances on the day she is raised; Sierin granted none, and\n      dismissed all male clerks in the Tower within a week, for various vague\n      reasons.  Three sisters were exiled from Tar Valon for a year, and two\n      were stripped, stretched on the triangle, and birched in the Traitor&apos;s\n      Court.  She is quite plump, and has a round face that seems constructed\n      for jolliness, but she wears grimness as though it were carved there.\n      She is slightly taller than <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>, and has\n      hard eyes.
