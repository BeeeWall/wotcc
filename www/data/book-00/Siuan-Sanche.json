She grew up on a fishing boat in Tear, and was sent on the\n      first boat bound for Tar Valon the day it was discovered she had the\n      spark of <i>saidar</i> inborn, in accordance with Tairen law.  Her\n      parents are now dead, her mother dying when she was very young.  Upon\n      arriving at the Tower, she very quickly became friends with\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and despite the large gap\n      between their incomes and lifestyles as children, they found they had a\n      remarkable amount in common.  The two moved at nearly the same rate\n      through their work with the Power, but Siuan seems to learn things like\n      history, language, and politics at a much faster rate.  In fact, she\n      arrived at the Tower barely able to read, and now she teaches\n      introductory classes in the Old Tongue.  She has very fair skin, clear\n      blue eyes, and is only a hand taller than Moiraine.  She has a talent\n      for puzzles.  Like Moiraine, she will some day become one of the\n      strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>.\n  "}]}
