She has iron-gray hair and black eyes, and\n      always wears ornaments in her hair.  She is the only woman who Moiraine\n      knows that is considerably stronger than Moiraine herself is in the\n      Power.  She was presumed dead until she appeared during the Aiel War.\n      It is said she bent Tower law whenever it suited her, flouted custom,\n      and always did her own thing, often dragging others with her.  It is\n      whispered that she even assaulted an <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin</a>\n      once.  <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a> knows this cannot be true&#x2014;she\n      would have been executed&#x2014;but she also admits that where her friend\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a> was born to lead, Cadsuane was born to\n      <i>command</i>.  She is the strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower for the\n      past 1000 years.\n  "}]}
