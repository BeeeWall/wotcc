During the Age of Legends, she was one of the best\n      Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world Heal\n      people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic; she\n      exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her\n      Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from\n      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall\n      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of\n      being severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her\n      &#x201C;pleasures.&#x201D;  She chose instead to pledge for the\n      <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and\n      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.\n      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark\n      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.\n      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that\n      <a href=\"#Sammael\">Sammael</a> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and\n      wears black most of the time&#x2014;perhaps because\n      <a href=\"#Lanfear\">Lanfear</a> always wore white.\n  "}]}
