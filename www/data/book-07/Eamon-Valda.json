He commanded the\n      troops that were near Tar Valon, and gave <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a> the\n      information on the Whitecloaks when he said he was curious.  Once Galad\n      joined the Whitecloak army, Valda promoted him quickly because of his\n      swordsmanship skill, claiming that he deserved recognition for his skill\n      regardless of where he obtained it.  Valda thinks that\n      <a href=\"#Niall\">Pedron Niall</a>&apos;s time as Lord Captain Commander of the\n      Children of the Light is coming to an end&#x2014;his skill as a military\n      commander earned him the right to have the position as long as he has,\n      but Valda thinks he is getting too old to be effective.  It is unknown\n      whether he was involved in <a href=\"#Omerna\">Omerna</a>&apos;s killing of\n      Niall, but since he was there immediately afterwards, it is likely he\n      played <i>some</i> role in it.  He has now taken Niall&apos;s place as Lord\n      Captain Commander.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Niall\">Niall, Pedron</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
