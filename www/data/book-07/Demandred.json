He has a hawk-like nose and dark hair.\n      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.  He was born\n      Barid Bel Medar one day after\n      <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,\n      and from the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin&apos;s\n      accomplishments, almost equal Lews Therin&apos;s strength, and almost\n      equal him but never surpass him in everything.  He became one of the\n      Light&apos;s greatest generals, once again second in command under Lews\n      Therin.  Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin&apos;s intellectual and\n      military superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead\n      the Light&apos;s forces over him during the War of the Shadow.
