Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less\n      a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend.

So far, Carridin\n      has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest\n      sister Dealda (carried from her bridal feast by a Fade).\n      His sister, <a href=\"#Vanora\">Vanora</a>, recently met with a similar\n      fate.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Shiaine\">Avarhin, Shiaine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Bors\">Bors</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Vanora\">Carridin, Vanora</a>.\n  "}]}
