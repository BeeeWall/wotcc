Her name means &#x201C;Spider&#x201D;\n      in the Old Tongue.  She always works from safety, attacks from safety,\n      and will run unless she can do so.  She developed a command of\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> that surpassed even\n      <a href=\"#Lanfear\">Lanfear</a>&apos;s mastery&#x2014;in the real world,\n      Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top Moghedien in\n      the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore, Moghedien\n      eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the Panarch of\n      Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>, who was trying to save\n      the Panarch at the time and take the seal on the\n      <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>&apos;s prison from its hold in the Palace.\n      She and Nynaeve fought in a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed\n      to better Moghedien, much to the surprise of both of them.\n      She managed to escape Nynaeve&apos;s tied off shield, and on their\n      next encounter, this one in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, she ripped\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>&apos;s soul out of the World of Dreams after\n      Birgitte almost killed her.  On her third encounter with Nynaeve,\n      Nynaeve managed to trap Moghedien with an <i>a&apos;dam</i>.\n      Moghedien remained bound by that <i>a&apos;dam</i> in Salidar, disguised as\n      <a href=\"#Marigan\">Marigan</a>, but was recently set free by\n      <a href=\"#Halima\">Halima</a>.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Marigan\">Marigan</a>.\n  "}]}
