She\n      retired to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due\n      to the difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather they way it\n      is.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when\n      refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of\n      the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most\n      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a\n      thousand years except <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>, <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>, and\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.  Although a Green, she has confronted and captured\n      more men that can channel than any other woman; unknown to most,\n      the men she captures tend to live longer after being gentled than the\n      average.\n  "}]}
