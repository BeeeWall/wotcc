Elaida names her to lead the\n      team of fifty sisters that she sends to Caemlyn to attempt to capture\n      any men who can channel that they find; unfortunately, she vastly\n      underestimates their numbers, and the entire team will most likely be\n      killed or captured in minutes once the Asha&apos;man realize what they intend\n      to do.  It is too late to call her back, however.\n  "}]}
