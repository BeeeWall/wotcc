His cutting of\n      <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i> to make a throne unlike\n      anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War.  The war\n      continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even\n      Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed\n      Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman&apos;s Pride, and his Sin, House\n      Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never\n      again reached any of its former glory&#x2014;but it also allowed Prophecy\n      to be fulfilled; the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a> was able to be\n      born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of a Maiden of the Spear but\n      raised by the blood of the old nations.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i>;\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>.\n  "}]}
