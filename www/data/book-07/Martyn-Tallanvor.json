When\n      <a href=\"#Gaebril\">Gaebril</a> had the guards swear new oaths to the\n      laws and customs of Andor (instead of to the Queen), Tallanvor swore\n      them but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in\n      the old style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood\n      will be shed before the Queen&apos;s will).  He loves his queen more than his\n      life, and now serves as her personal bodyguard.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
