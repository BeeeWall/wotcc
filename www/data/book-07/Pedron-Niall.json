He was trying to get Altara and Murandy to cede\n      land to Illian so the Council of Nine wouldn&apos;t invade both countries.\n      He also tried to expand Amadicia&apos;s borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His\n      headquarters is in Amadicia, and he ruled there even above\n      <a href=\"#Ailron\">King Ailron</a>, although this was not spoken of\n      openly.  Niall recently offered a treaty with\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor,\n      offering Whitecloak assistance to retake her throne in exchange\n      for Whitecloak presence in Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence\n      that Morgase had not allowed even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall\n      was killed by his alleged Spymaster, <a href=\"#Omerna\">Abdel Omerna</a>,\n      who claimed he had gone against everything the Children stood for by\n      allowing Morgase to avoid being put to the question.  He was replaced by\n      <a href=\"#Valda\">Eamon Valda</a>, who also killed Omerna.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Balwer\">Balwer, Sebban</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Valda\">Valda, Eamon</a>.\n  "}]}
