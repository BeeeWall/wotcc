He left the\n      <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to see the world; by Ogier standards,\n      he is not yet old enough to leave the <i>stedding</i> without permission\n      from the Council of Elders.  He is fond of books and history, and is an\n      excellent Treesinger.  He is writing a book about his travels with the\n      three <i>ta&apos;veren</i> he meets, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>, and <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>.\n      Loial is constantly afraid that his mother will find him and try to\n      marry him off and settle him down; however, he does like his mother&apos;s\n      choice of wives for him, <a href=\"#Erith\">Erith</a>.  He, like most of the Ogier,\n      is sad that most humans don&apos;t remember the Ogier, and is horrified that\n      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Erith\">Erith</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Karldin\">Manfor, Karldin</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
