She is dark and slender with black\n      hair and dark eyes.  She has one surviving Warder,\n      Ihvon; her other, Owein,\n      died in the Two Rivers while scouting the\n      Whitecloak camp.  She thinks that <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a>, and <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> should be\n      bonded as Warders to &#x201C;keep an eye on them,&#x201D; but <i>says</i>,\n      &#x201C;I am not so lost to custom yet as to bond a man against his will.\n      Not quite yet.&#x201D;  This appears to have changed, however, since one\n      of the first things she did after seeing Rand was to bond him.  She\n      later found that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it\n      impossible to compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it\n      to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she\n      constantly feels the pain he experiences from the wound in his side,\n      perhaps even more severely than he feels it.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>.\n  "}]}
