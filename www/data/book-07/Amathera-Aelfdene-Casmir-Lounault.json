She vanished, allegedly at\n      Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies.  In reality, Amathera\n      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under\n      <a href=\"#Liandrin\">Liandrin</a>, and was rescued by\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> and <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>.  They\n      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the\n      mob outside the Panarch&apos;s Palace (since it is not all that far from\n      &#x201C;The Panarch is dead!&#x201D; to &#x201C;Death to the\n      Panarch!&#x201D;), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan\n      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new\n      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.\n      She now serves as a dancer for <a href=\"#Suroth\">High Lady Suroth</a>,\n      the leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Thera\">Thera</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
