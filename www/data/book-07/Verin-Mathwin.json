Her Warder\n      is named Tomas.  She is more interested in current\n      events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what\n      happened now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted\n      stone ring <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once\n      told <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a> that there was really no need to keep\n      her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a\n      novice, since she wouldn&apos;t ever be able to do much with it anyway.  When\n      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <a href=\"#Alanna\">Alanna</a>, they\n      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they\n      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>&apos;s sister Bode.  When she and\n      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and\n      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is\n      quite old&#x2014;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai\n      means she is quite old indeed.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Alanna\">Mosvani, Alanna</a>.\n  "}]}
