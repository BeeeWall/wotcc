She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen\n      in Emond&apos;s Field.  She left when four of her villagers were taken away\n      from the Two Rivers by <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>.  While the group traveled away from her home and\n      toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could channel\n      the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she\n      was doing; she developed feelings for al&apos;Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&apos;s\n      Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has\n      a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in\n      the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power; only a select\n      few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her.  When she\n      arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a\n      novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source\n      unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her\n      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by\n      <a href=\"#Liandrin\">Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the\n      Seanchan as <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> was.  After she returned to the\n      Tower, <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt\n      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in\n      Tanchico, she encountered <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a> and managed\n      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two\n      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,\n      leashing her with an <i>a&apos;dam</i> in <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve\n      took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Rahvin\">Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last\n      moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash\n      with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw\n      to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of\n      himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept Moghedien\n      under control with a modified <i>a&apos;dam</i> in Salidar.  Nynaeve wished\n      to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the\n      Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part\n      of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,\n      and has already managed to Heal gentling.\n      Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not\n      of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond.\n      She was not told that Lan&apos;s bond had been passed to\n      <a href=\"#Myrelle\">Myrelle</a> the moment of Moiraine&apos;s death.\n      <i>Editor&apos;s note:  in chapter&#xA0;22, we find out that Nynaeve\n      </i>looks<i> to be about 21 years old, but we know that she is closer\n      to 28 or so in reality.</i>\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Lan\">Mandragoran, Lan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Marigan\">Marigan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>.\n  "}]}
