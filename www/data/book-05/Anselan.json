Barashelle had bonded a Warder as\n      an Accepted; this was strictly forbidden, even though she was to be\n      raised to the shawl the next day.

The Amyrlin made her transfer his bond to another\n      woman, and forced her to bond Anselan.  Anselan was cold to her, and she\n      spent most of her life trying to make him see her with respect.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Barashelle\">Barashelle</a>.\n  "}]}
