She has\n      considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be one\n      of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  It is also thought\n      that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she\n      is currently in training with the Wise Ones to learn more of this\n      Talent.  Egwene is good friends with\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne Trakand</a>, the\n      Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn.  In fact, Rand and\n      Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels an\n      almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot\n      get married, and don&apos;t really want to.
