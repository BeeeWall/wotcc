She seems\n      completely besotted with him, at least to the outside observer.  Gaebril\n      arrived in Caemlyn just as riots sprang up throughout the city, and he\n      joined and led one of the factions.  His faction restored order in the\n      city, and upon Morgase&apos;s return from Tar Valon, he gave her her kingdom\n      in one piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so happy that\n      he had done this that she sent <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>, her\n      Aes Sedai advisor, away and made Gaebril her advisor.  However, during\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>&apos;s trip through Caemlyn to deliver\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>&apos;s letter, he overheard Gaebril ordering\n      someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&#x2014;he tried to find a\n      way to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne\n      when he found out it was Gaebril whom he had overheard.  Gaebril is\n      actually <a href=\"#Rahvin\">Rahvin</a>, one of the Forsaken.  He has been\n      Compelling Morgase to obey him, though he has noticed that she is less\n      pliable than he expected&#x2014;as if her mind seeks a way out of the\n      Compulsion despite not knowing it is trapped.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rahvin\">Rahvin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
