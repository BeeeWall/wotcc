Thom is good\n      at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks.  He also\n      carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in\n      various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread\n      from Thom to <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> and <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>.  Thom\n      was originally a bard in <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal\n      Court, and for a time after her husband\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Taringail Damodred</a> died,\n      he was the Queen&apos;s lover.  During his run from a Fade\n      at Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of\n      it.  Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he\n      cannot do the backflips and other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> and <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> on their\n      travels as per <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>&apos;s request, despite the\n      fact that he has never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his\n      nephew, Owyn, was gentled by the Red Ajah.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
