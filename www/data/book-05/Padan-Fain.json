A Darkfriend,\n      he was given orders to locate the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>\n      and narrowed it to three boys in Emond&apos;s Field.  While persuing them, he\n      encountered the spirit of <a href=\"#Mordeth\">Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now\n      called Shadar Logoth.  Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul, but\n      instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either\n      of them alone.  Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has\n      his own evil agenda.  It is said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless is\n      fear,&#x201D; from observing that a Myrddraal&apos;s look causes fear in the\n      hearts of men.  Fain&apos;s look has that effect on Myrddraal&#x2014;Fades\n      feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade.\n      <i>Machin Shin</i>, the Black Wind of the Ways\n      which is perfectly alright with consuming Trollocs alive,\n      did not consume Fain&apos;s soul, instead welcoming him as an old friend.\n      Fain is also called\n      <a href=\"#Ordeith\">Ordeith</a>, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak\n      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil and dangerous man alive.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Mordeth\">Mordeth</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Ordeith\">Ordeith</a>.\n  "}]}
