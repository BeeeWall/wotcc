He is quite tall, and does not get\n      very emotional&#x2014;in fact, he has &#x201C;emotional walls&#x201D; that\n      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by\n      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great\n      Blight.  Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man\n      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought\n      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was\n      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least\n      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a>, <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>, and\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he\n      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he\n      was the last to notice it:  love for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,\n      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&apos;s emotional walls and break them\n      down without him even knowing they were there.  He loves her very much,\n      whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise and\n      his, loves him in return.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <i><a href=\"#Aan\">Aan&apos;allein</a></i>;\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>.\n  "}]}
