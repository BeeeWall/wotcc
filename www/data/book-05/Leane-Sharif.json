Just as her family members were\n      training her in the seductive ways of Domani women, Leane found that\n      her life would take a different direction:  she could channel\n      <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.  She became an\n      Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup led by\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Alviarin\">Alviarin Freidhen</a>\n      that deposed Siuan, Leane was thrown in the dungeon and\n      stilled.  Leane has turned to her seductive side to try to replace what\n      she lost in stilling; she is out of practice, but does well enough.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Amaena\">Amaena</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Alviarin\">Freidhen, Alviarin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Resara\">Resara</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>.\n  "}]}
