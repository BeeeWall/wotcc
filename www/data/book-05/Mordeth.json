He\n      had the idea to use evil as a weapon against evil, and eventually drove\n      the Trollocs away from the city.  Unfortunately, the city and its\n      inhabitants were so consumed by evil that the entire city is still\n      tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol.  The city is now known as\n      Shadar Logoth, &#x201C;Where the Shadow Waits.&#x201D;  Mordeth&apos;s soul\n      remained in Shadar Logoth for millenia&#x2014;he could not leave the city\n      unless he accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry\n      something from the city to the outside world.  Strangely enough, both of\n      these things happened at the same time, when\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a>\n      carried the ruby-handled dagger from the city while\n      <a href=\"#Fain\">Padan Fain</a> accompanied Mordeth out of the city at\n      about the same time.  Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul while the\n      dagger tried to consume Mat&apos;s.  In Fain&apos;s case, the attempt to consume\n      his soul was not completely successful&#x2014;instead, the two souls\n      merged to create something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain\n      alone.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Fain\">Fain, Padan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Ordeith\">Ordeith</a>.\n  "}]}
