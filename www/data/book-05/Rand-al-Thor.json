He grew up as a shepherd, but is now recognized as\n      the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Rand can channel the One Power\n      with incredible strength; he is stronger than any man or woman that ever\n      lived except for <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a>.  In fact, Rand\n      <i>is</i> Lews Therin reborn&#x2014;he even hears Lews Therin&apos;s\n      voice speaking to him in his head sometimes.  He is also recognized as\n      <a href=\"#Dawn\">He Who Comes With the Dawn</a>, the man prophesied to\n      unite the clans of the Aiel, and as the <a href=\"#Coramoor\">Coramoor</a>,\n      the man who will end the Atha&apos;an Miere&apos;s long voyage at sea.  According\n      to one of <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewings, Rand is destined to fall in\n      love with three women, and they with him.  These women are Min herself,\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>, and <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>.  Rand\n      is also good friends with <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>, and with\n      fellow <i>ta&apos;veren</i> <a href=\"#Mat\">Matrim Cauthon</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>, all of which grew up in Emond&apos;s\n      Field as well.  Rand was raised by Tam al&apos;Thor and his\n      wife Kari, but his real parents were\n      <a href=\"#Janduin\">Janduin</a>, chief of the Taardad Aiel who led the four\n      clans across the Dragonwall to kill <a href=\"#Laman\">King Laman</a>, and\n      Shaiel, a Maiden of the Spear who actually grew up\n      on the wet side of the Spine of the World as well.  <i>Note:  when Rand\n      passed through Caemlyn, several people commented that he bore a striking\n      resemblance to <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Tigraine</a>, the former Daughter-Heir\n      of Andor who disappeared years ago.  Since Shaiel never gave her name, it\n      is probably safe to assume that Tigraine is Rand&apos;s mother, and thus Rand\n      and <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a> are half-brothers.</i>\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Aybara, Perrin</a>;\n      <i><a href=\"#Caracarn\">Car&apos;a&apos;carn</a></i>;\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Cauthon, Matrim</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Coramoor\">Coramoor</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Damodred, Tigraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon, The</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Dawn\">He Who Comes With the Dawn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Janduin\">Janduin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Lews\">Telamon, Lews Therin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>.\n  "}]}
