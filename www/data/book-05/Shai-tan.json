At the moment of Creation,\n      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.\n      This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored\n      into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore,\n      allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new\n      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free\n      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the\n      War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&apos;s side), during\n      which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their\n      lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and\n      were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War\n      of the Shadow did not end until <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,\n      the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and\n      re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison.  At the moment of sealing,\n      Shai&apos;tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and\n      tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming\n      all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.\n      These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and\n      the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.  Only\n      three of them still hold, as far as is known, and despite being made of\n      <i>cuendillar</i>, they would break by a fall from a table.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Baal\">Ba&apos;alzamon</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Creator\">Creator, The</a>.\n  "}]}
