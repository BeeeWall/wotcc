Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in\n      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges against\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a>.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah\n      would most likely have been divided over whether to depose Siuan, and\n      only the Red would be behind Elaida.  This would most likely lead to the\n      stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>.\n  "}]}
