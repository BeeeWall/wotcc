She tried to use the Tower&apos;s\n      influence to manipulate Hawkwing and make him a puppet ruler of the White\n      Tower.  This ended in disaster, as Hawkwing laid seige to Tar Valon and\n      attempted to destroy the Aes Sedai stronghold&#x2014;he nearly succeeded.\n      Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for nearly destroying\n      the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has been raised.  She\n      was succeeded by Deane Aryman of the Blue Ajah,\n      who attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did to the Tower&apos;s reputation,\n      and succeeded for the most part.  Unfortunately, this created extreme\n      tension between the Red and Blue Ajahs that still exists today, and is\n      the main reason why the Red Ajah will (and did) take any pretext to pull\n      down an Amyrlin raised from the Blue Ajah.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Deane\">Aryman, Deane</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Artur\">Paendrag Tanreall, Artur</a>.\n  "}]}
