Her name is that of a spider that lived during the Age of\n      Legends&#x2014;those spiders spun webs in non-obvious places, and their\n      bites killed in seconds.  She always attacks from safety, if at all\n      possible.  While Moghedien was in Tanchico, she was bested in a\n      proverbial wrestling match (with <i>saidar</i> instead of muscles) by\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a>.  She managed to escape because\n      Nynaeve did not know that tied off shields could be defeated, and vows\n      to have revenge.\n  "}]}
