He is half-brother to\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> and <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a>.  Stunningly\n      handsome, even <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> has trouble blushing when\n      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai will often forsake their work to watch\n      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with\n      the sword, and has acheived Blademaster status in practice if not in\n      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that\n      accompanied <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a>&apos;s deposition and joined\n      <a href=\"#Valda\">Eamon Valda</a>&apos;s band of the Children of the Light.\n      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position\n      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he\n      became a Whitecloak because it &#x201C;felt right.&#x201D;  He is extremely\n      virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it\n      hurts, even himself.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point down.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Damodred, Taringail</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Damodred, Tigraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
