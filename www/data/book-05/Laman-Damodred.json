His cutting of\n      <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i> to make a throne unlike\n      anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War.  The war\n      continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even\n      Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed\n      Laman and took his sword.
