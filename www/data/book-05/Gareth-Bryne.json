He now lives on his private estates\n      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women\n      who unintentionally burned a barn: <a href=\"#Mara\">Mara Tomanes</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Amaena\">Amaena</a>, and <a href=\"#Serenla\">Serenla</a>.  When\n      these three made an oath to serve him and then apparently broke it, he\n      followed them out of sheer curiosity.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Sharif, Leane</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
