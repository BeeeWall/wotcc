He dismantled Amalasan&apos;s armies\n      despite having smaller forces to begin with, and created an empire that\n      contained most of the known world.  He was <i>ta&apos;veren</i>, possibly the\n      most strongly so in history with the exception of\n      <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>.  <i>Note:  it\n      is not known exactly how strongly </i>ta&apos;veren<i> Hawkwing was, and it\n      is difficult to judge the strength of <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a> because of their proximity to Rand,\n      but it is likely he was stronger than they are, too.</i>  Hawkwing even\n      went as far as sending armies across the Aryth Ocean under his son\n      Luthair; contact with these armies was lost at\n      Hawkwing&apos;s death, but their descendants have returned from across the\n      ocean to reclaim the land.  They are known as the Seanchan.  His death\n      also set off the War of the Hundred Years.  Hawkwing is one of the\n      heroes bound to the Horn of Valere; he led them when Mat sounded the\n      Horn at Falme.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Hawkwing\">Hawkwing, Artur</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
