She has short dark hair that she\n      keeps like most boys her age do.  She is slender, and barely taller than\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>.  Her dark eyes are bigger than\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>&apos;s.  She dresses like most boys do, a habit\n      she picked up from her hours in the mines with her father; her mother\n      is dead.  Min has a special ability, known to few; she can see images\n      around people that predict their future.  Moiraine calls them pieces of\n      the Pattern.  She sees a lot of things around <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>\n      and his friends, but she claims that if she told Rand everything she saw\n      about him, he would be as curly-haired as his &#x201C;friend with the\n      shoulders.&#x201D;\n  "}]}
