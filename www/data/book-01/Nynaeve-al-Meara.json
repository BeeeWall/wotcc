She has brown hair and eyes, and is quite\n      slender.  She has been studying under <a href=\"#Barran\">Doral Barran</a>,\n      the Wisdom of Emond&apos;s Field, for about three years.  Many people in the\n      village think she is too young to be apprenticed to a Wisdom, and that\n      Mistress Barran should have chosen someone years older when Nynaeve&apos;s\n      predecessor died mysteriously.  Nynaeve is a very quick learner, and\n      has been allowed to braid her hair for a year now.  She has developed\n      the ability to sense <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>&apos;s presence without\n      seeing her since the end of the breakbone fever epidemic.  Mistress\n      Barran seems to have caught on to some of Nynaeve&apos;s abilities&#x2014;she\n      seemed disappointed that the wound Nynaeve was bandaging did not seem\n      more healed than it was when she started.\n      After Mistress Barran&apos;s death, Nynaeve herself became the Wisdom.\n      Her adult height is about as tall as <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>&apos;s shoulder.\n      Many people <i>still</i> think Nynaeve is too young to be the Wisdom;\n      however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by the\n      stick she carries.\n  "}]}
