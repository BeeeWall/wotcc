He is still larger of build\n      than both of them, however, which works well for a blacksmith.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Adora\">Aybara, Adora</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Con\">Aybara, Con</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Deselle\">Aybara, Deselle</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Joslyn\">Aybara, Joslyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Paetram\">Aybara, Paetram</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Cauthon, Matrim</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Luhhan\">Luhhan, Haral</a>.\n  "}]}
