His name means\n      &#x201C;Death&#x201D; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name more.\n      He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from the\n      <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>; the <i>saa</i> have already appeared in\n      his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most thought\n      it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the <i>saa</i>\n      appeared).  Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the Pattern to\n      behave how he wants it to&#x2014;he knows that with someone as strongly\n      <i>ta&apos;veren</i> as <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, that is all but impossible,\n      not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep everything in\n      chaos (as per the <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>&apos;s command, &#x201C;Let the\n      Lord of Chaos Rule&#x201D;), hoping that subtle manipulations will\n      further his goals.  He has been declared\n      <a href=\"#Naeblis\">Nae&apos;blis</a>, the one to be second only to the\n      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the\n      <i>cour&apos;souvra</i> controlling the minds of\n      <a href=\"#Cyndane\">Cyndane</a> and <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>.\n      He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True\n      Power&#x2014;the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even\n      should they want to.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Ishamael\">Ishamael</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Naeblis\">Nae&apos;blis</a>.\n  "}]}
