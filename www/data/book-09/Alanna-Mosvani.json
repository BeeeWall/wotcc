She is dark and slender with black\n      hair and dark eyes.  She has two surviving Warders,\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> (whom she bonded against his will) and\n      <a href=\"#Ihvon\">Ihvon</a>; her other, Owein, died\n      in the Two Rivers while scouting the Whitecloak camp.  She later found\n      that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it impossible to\n      Compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it to attempting\n      to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she constantly feels the\n      pain he experiences from the wound in his side, perhaps even more\n      severely than he feels it.\n  "}]}
