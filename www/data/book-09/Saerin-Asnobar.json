She carries a curved knife, in the\n      fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white at her dark\n      temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only a Warder\n      could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the Hall for\n      forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150.  Everyone knows to be\n      wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of an innkeeper, and was\n      first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an organization similar to,\n      but shorter-lived and smaller than, the Kin)&#x2014;she was the only one\n      of them to ever obtain the shawl.\n  "}]}
