His first wife, Tigraine, the\n      then Daughter-Heir of Andor, bore him a son, Galad,\n      before she vanished, causing the War of Succession.

He died when Elayne was barely old enough\n      to remember him, which was probably fortunate for Morgase; unbeknownst\n      to her, he had planned to engineer her death and make himself the first\n      King of Andor in a millenium.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
