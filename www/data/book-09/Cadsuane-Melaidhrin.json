She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower,\n      when refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head\n      of the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most\n      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand\n      years except perhaps for <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> and <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>.\n      Although a Green, she has confronted and captured more men that can\n      channel than any other woman; unknown to most, the men she captures tend\n      to live longer after being gentled than the average.\n      She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes Sedai.  According\n      to <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>, Cadsuane will teach <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>\n      and the Asha&apos;man something&#x2014;they will not like it,\n      especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.\n      She is the oldest Aes Sedai alive.\n  "}]}
