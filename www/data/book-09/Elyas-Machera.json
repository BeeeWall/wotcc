He was a Warder\n      at one time, and left the Tower when he discoverd that he could talk to\n      wolves.  He did not find any problem with the ability by itself, but\n      felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who thought they should\n      gentle him (even though there was nothing to be gentled) because of his\n      ability.  Elyas helped Perrin learn that he could talk to wolves as\n      well; Perrin doesn&apos;t necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over\n      the dislike of it as well.  The wolves call him\n      Long Tooth.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>.\n  "}]}
