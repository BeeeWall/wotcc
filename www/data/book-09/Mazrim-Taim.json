He later escaped his captors, possibly with Black Ajah\n      assistance (although this is totally unconfirmed).  Hearing of\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>&apos;s amnesty, Taim came to Caemlyn and became the\n      head of Rand&apos;s school of male channelers.  He is almost as strong in the\n      One Power as Rand is.  Taim claims to have held off the madness that\n      normally accompanies the taint for almost 35 years&#x2014;he has been\n      using the One Power for a very long time, and knows many tricks that\n      Rand had not thought of on his own or been taught by\n      Asmodean, such as how to test men for the ability.\n      He seems to resent being second\n      to Rand, and also gave orders to kill Rand.\n      He is almost as tall as Rand, has a hooked nose and dark eyes.\n      He is a physically powerful and graceful man,\n      although his skill with a sword is lacking.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#MHael\">M&apos;Hael</a>.\n  "}]}
