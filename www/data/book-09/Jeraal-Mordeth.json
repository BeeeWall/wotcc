{"id":"Jeraal-Mordeth","name":"Jeraal Mordeth","chapters":[{"title":"Glossary","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Jeraaal\">Jeraal Mordeth</a>,\n      p. 662 (772)&#x2014;Name used by <a href=\"#Fain\">Padan Fain</a> as a disguise to\n      be one of <a href=\"#Toram\">Toram Riatin</a>&apos;s advisers.  It is the name\n      of the man whose soul controls about half of Fain&apos;s mind.  Mordeth\n      became a counsellor in Aridhol during the Trolloc\n      Wars.  He advised that to defeat the Shadow, Aridhol must be harder than\n      the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel.  Slowly it became so, until\n      finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark.  The city\n      finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand,\n      every rock, every sip of water with its hatred.  Mordeth&apos;s soul remained\n      in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (&quot;Where the Shadow Waits&quot;) for\n      millenia&#x2014;he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a\n      person to the city walls or had them carry something from the city to\n      the outside world.  Strangely enough,\n      both of these things happened at the same time,\n      when <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat Cauthon</a> carried the ruby-handled\n      dagger from the city while <a href=\"#Fain\">Padan Fain</a> accompanied\n      Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.  Mordeth attempted to\n      consume Fain&apos;s soul while the dagger tried to consume Mat&apos;s.  In Fain&apos;s\n      case, the attempt to consume his soul was not completely\n      successful&#x2014;instead, the two souls merged to create something more\n      evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels incomplete\n      without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.\n      Mordeth, Fain, or whatever you wish to call him has since deserted\n      Toram.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Fain\">Fain, Padan</a>.\n"}]}
