He is quite the ladies&apos; man.\n      Thom is good at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other\n      tricks.  He also carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his\n      boots, and in various other locations on his body; this practice seems\n      to have spread from Thom to <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>, and <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a>.  Thom was\n      originally a bard in <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a>&apos;s Royal Court,\n      and for a time after her husband\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Taringail Damodred</a> died,\n      he was the Queen&apos;s lover.  During his run from a Fade\n      at Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of\n      it.  Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he\n      cannot do the backflips and other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> and <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> on their\n      travels as per <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>&apos;s request, despite the\n      fact that he has never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his\n      nephew, Owyn, was gentled by the Red Ajah.\n      Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in fact, his girlfried\n      Dena was killed by Cairhienin\n      soldiers because they thought he was trying to play <i>Daes Daemar</i>\n      against the Royal House.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
