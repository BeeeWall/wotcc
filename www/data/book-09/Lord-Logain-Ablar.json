He got loose during the chaos surrounding the deposing of\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>, and eventually was escorted out of\n      Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled\n      he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of\n      loyal soldiers.  <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo\n      over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure\n      of great power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain has come\n      forward with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up\n      to declaring himself the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely\n      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more\n      glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.  Logain was recently\n      Healed by <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>, and was let free by\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> to do as he pleased.  He chose to return to\n      the Black Tower, and now leads a part of the Asha&apos;man that seem to be\n      discontent with <a href=\"#Taim\">Taim</a>&apos;s leadership.  When Aes Sedai came to\n      the Black Tower to attempt to capture the Asha&apos;man (not realizing\n      their numbers), Logain bonded two sisters to him as &#x201C;wives&#x201D;\n      using the &#x201C;wife bond&#x201D; that the Asha&apos;man developed,\n      <a href=\"#Toveine\">Toveine Gazal</a> of the Red Ajah and\n      <a href=\"#Gabrelle\">Gabrelle</a> of the Brown Ajah.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon, The</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.\n  "}]}
