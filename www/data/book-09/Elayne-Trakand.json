She is also half-sister to\n      Galad, although she would rather not be reminded of\n      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not\n      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and\n      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,\n      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>, <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>, and some trainees.  She has\n      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne\n      realized she loved <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and told him how she\n      felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> meant about &#x201C;having to share him,&#x201D; but\n      now knows about Min&apos;s viewing of Rand with the three women&apos;s heads,\n      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,\n      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with\n      <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended up bonding\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being only\n      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte&apos;s life.  Elayne later\n      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter&apos;angreal</i>\n      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon\n      hearing news of her mother&apos;s disappearance; she plans to take the Lion\n      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Amys\">Amys</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Damodred, Taringail</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Farshaw, Elmindreda</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Shyanda\">Shyanda</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Dyelin\">Taravin, Dyelin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
