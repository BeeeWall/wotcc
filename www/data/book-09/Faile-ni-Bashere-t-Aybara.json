When she became a Hunter,\n      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the\n      name &#x201C;Mandarb&#x201D;&#x2014;she chose Faile when she found that\n      Mandarb was the name of <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s\n      horse.  She fell in love with <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a> while\n      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.\n      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> was the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a> and\n      that both he and Perrin are <i>ta&apos;veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,\n      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off\n      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were\n      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,\n      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which\n      she trained herself.  Her name means &#x201C;falcon&#x201D; in the Old\n      Tongue; she is the falcon in <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewings of Perrin.\n      She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she can to\n      make sure he not so much as <i>looks</i> at another woman, even though\n      he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife, especially\n      toward people like <a href=\"#Berelain\">Berelain</a> who eye her husband\n      all the time.  She even cornered <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> when they first\n      came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure Min had no\n      intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin to Ghealdan to find\n      <a href=\"#Masema\">Masema</a>, and while he was away her party was\n      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <i>gai&apos;shain</i> by\n      them.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Bashere\">Bashere, Davram t&apos;Ghaline</a>.\n  "}]}
