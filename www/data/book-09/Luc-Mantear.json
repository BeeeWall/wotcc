{"id":"Luc-Mantear","name":"Luc Mantear","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 22:  Out of Thin Air","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Luc\">Luc Mantear</a>,\n      p. 448 (517)&#x2014;Son of\n      Queen Mordrellen of Andor and\n      brother to Tigraine.\n      Gitara Moroso, then advisor to the Queen,\n      told him that his fame&#x2014;or his\n      fate&#x2014;lay in the Great Blight.  He disappeared from Andor into the\n      Blight shortly before Tigraine disappeared, and\n      was never seen again.  Luc&apos;s soul in fact was merged with the soul of\n      <a href=\"#Isam\">Isam Mandragoran</a>, <a href=\"#Lan\">Lan</a>&apos;s cousin,\n      who disappeared into the Blight at about the same time.  Luc/Isam now\n      roams <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i> as a unified entity that can change back\n      and forth between the two identities readily.  The combined entity now\n      serves as an assassin for the Shadow.  It was Luc who killed the Gray\n      Man that <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> and <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>\n      stumbled upon in the Tower.  Unlike pretty much everyone else, Luc is\n      aware that <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> is his nephew.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Isam\">Mandragoran, Isam</a>.\n\n\n  "}]}
