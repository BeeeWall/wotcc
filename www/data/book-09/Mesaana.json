During the Age of Legends, Mesaana was told she was unfit\n      to do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.\n      She spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated\n      her life to the <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>.  During the War of Power,\n      she created &#x201C;schools&#x201D; for the children, at which she taught\n      the children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her\n      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where\n      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.\n      She has been cooperating with <a href=\"#Semirhage\">Semirhage</a> to some\n      extent, and has taught <a href=\"#Alviarin\">Alviarin</a> to Travel.  She\n      was displeased that Alviarin had ordered <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>\n      beaten.  <i>Mesaana has obviously taken the identity of a sister in the\n      Tower.  Who is not known entirely.  Some suggest that she may be\n      a dreamy Brown with no friends who helped depose\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a>.  It would fit, but I for one am not\n      completely convinced; there just is not enough evidence either\n      way.</i>\n  "}]}
