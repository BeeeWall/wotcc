He cut the first&apos;s head\n      off, <i>threw</i> his sword at the second and speared him with it, and\n      took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it.  He is\n      wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot.  He\n      is fond of teasing women.  He claims to have been a merchant&apos;s guard,\n      then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn.  He is now a lieutenant in\n      the Queen&apos;s Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him the captain of her\n      bodyguard.  He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or\n      handsome.  He moves with a swordsman&apos;s grace, and is very strong.\n      Mellar claims to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claims to have\n      fought on <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a>&apos;s side during the Succession.\n      Half the palace has accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne&apos;s\n      twins, though he himself may be unaware that this rumor exists.\n      Unbeknownst to Elayne or practically anyone else, he also answers to the\n      name <a href=\"#Hanlon\">Daved Hanlon</a>, a Darkfriend.  To him, a name\n      is akin to a coat&#x2014;to be changed regularly and to suit the\n      conditions.  Elayne is growing more than suspicious of his loyalties,\n      but she cannot act without proof.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Hanlon\">Hanlon, Daved</a>.\n  "}]}
