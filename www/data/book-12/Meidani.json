She has golden brown hair\n      to the middle of her back.\n      Her Warder is Leonin.\n      She was one of the Aes Sedai sent back to the Tower by the Aes Sedai in\n      Salidar as a spy under the guise that she was obeying\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>&apos;s summons;\n      she and Elaida were once pillow friends as novices, and the Hall in\n      exile thought she might be able to renew that relationship to their\n      advantage. Elaida is apparently aware of her mission, and makes vicious,\n      thinly-veiled threats to her, such as asking her to look up how\n      traitors have been punished throughout Tower history.\n      Her quarters are surprisingly comfortable and homey, and are indicative\n      of someone who <i>loves</i> to travel.  Maps hang on the walls, as\n      prized art would hang on another&apos;s walls.  She has a pair of Aiel\n      spears on the walls as well as a pair of Sea Folk earrings.  Everything\n      is tagged with its source and date of collection.  She grew up in\n      Altara.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>.\n  "}]}
