She has chin-length dark hair and watery blue eyes.\n      During the Age of Legends, Mesaana was told she was unfit to\n      do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.  She\n      spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated her\n      life to the <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>.  During the War of Power, she\n      created &#x201C;schools&#x201D; for the children, at which she taught\n      the children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her\n      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where\n      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.\n      She has been cooperating with <a href=\"#Semirhage\">Semirhage</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Demandred\">Demandred</a> to some extent,\n      and taught <a href=\"#Alviarin\">Alviarin</a> to Travel.
