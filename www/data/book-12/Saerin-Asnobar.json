She carries a curved\n      knife, in the fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white\n      at her dark temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only\n      a Warder could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the\n      Hall for forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150 years.\n      Everyone knows to be wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of\n      an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an\n      organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than, the\n      Kin)&#x2014;she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl.\n      She is good at taking charge of things, and immediately took charge\n      of the organization to fetter out Darkfriends in the Tower with\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Pevara</a>, dismissing\n      <a href=\"#Seaine\">Seaine</a> from her position.\n      She has olive skin.
