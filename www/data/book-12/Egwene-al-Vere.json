{"id":"Egwene-al-Vere","name":"Egwene al'Vere","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 1:  Tears from Steel","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Egwene\">Egwene al&apos;Vere</a>,\n      p. 51&#x2014;Young\n      woman from Emond&apos;s Field and daughter of the innkeeper there,\n      now raised to the <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>\n      among the Aes Sedai opposing <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>.  She\n      has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be\n      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also\n      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the\n      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.\n      Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by\n      <a href=\"#Liandrin\">Liandrin</a> to <a href=\"#Suroth\">Suroth</a> to be\n      made <i>damane</i>.  She was held captive under the name\n      Tuli\n      under care of the <i>sul&apos;dam</i> <a href=\"#Renna\">Renna Emain</a>.\n      When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her <i>a&apos;dam</i> in place;\n      the fact that Renna was bound by the <i>a&apos;dam</i> threatens to destroy\n      the foundation of Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of\n      women who can channel.  Egwene is good friends with\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne Trakand</a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is\n      also a childhood friend of <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all\n      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost\n      sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get\n      married, and do not want to.  Egwene is the love object of both of\n      Elayne&apos;s brothers, <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions,\n      but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had\n      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene\n      was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when\n      the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be\n      manipulated by them without too much trouble;\n      if this was their intent, they\n      made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest\n      Amyrlins in history.  Egwene has enlisted\n      <a href=\"#Bryne\">Gareth Bryne</a>\n      as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> from power.\n      She has also opened the novice books to all\n      interested women for the first time in history&#x2014;in the past, they\n      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women\n      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased\n      the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original,\n      unified one.  The number of novices has increased to levels not known\n      for over a thousand years.  Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents\n      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of\n      <i>cuendillar</i>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with\n      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of\n      <i>cuendillar</i> by <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a> while she was\n      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone.  She has recovered\n      some other abilities through Moghedien as well.  She plans to reunite\n      the Tower and make it stronger than ever&#x2014;and she plans to start by\n      exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into\n      fragments that will never be gathered up again.\n      Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan\n      to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to <i>cuendillar</i>.\n      She is now a prisoner in the Tower, and has been re-enlisted as a Novice\n      again.  She accepts all punishments Elaida and others impose upon her\n      for insisting that she is still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai.\n      Her strong will and persistence have earned her the respect of nearly\n      all the novices and perhaps several of the Accepted as well.\n      Egwene plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions and\n      hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible; she speaks\n      to anyone that seems willing to ponder those suggestions.\n      More urgently, Egwene is attempting to convince the Hall&#x2014;both the\n      Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile&#x2014;that they must be prepared\n      for the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat, The</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Renna\">Emain, Renna</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>.\n  "}]}
