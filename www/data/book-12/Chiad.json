She is short for an Aiel\n      woman, and has blonde hair and gray eyes.\n      <a href=\"#Gaul\">Gaul</a> wants her to marry him, but she will not give\n      up the spear.  She is willing to be his lover, but marriage is out of\n      the question (or so she says).  She is first-sister to\n      <a href=\"#Bain\">Bain</a>, and the two served as a sort of honor guard\n      for <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a>.  She and Bain were captured along with\n      Faile by the Shaido and made <i>gai&apos;shain</i>.  She has refused Faile&apos;s\n      offer of escape once her plan is ready; she vows to serve her year and a\n      day, as prescribed by <i>ji&apos;e&apos;toh</i>, and then walk away.\n      The Shaido to which she was sworn was killed by <a href=\"#Gaul\">Gaul</a>\n      during the battle; Gaul had to kill about a dozen Aiel warriors in order\n      to get to Chiad, and was somewhat disappointed to find that Bain was\n      also <i>gai&apos;shain</i> to one of them.  Chiad is little more than a\n      finger taller than her adopted first-sister.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Bain\">Bain</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gaul\">Gaul</a>.\n  "}]}
