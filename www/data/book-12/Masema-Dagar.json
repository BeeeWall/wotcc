He was once one of\n      Uno&apos;s underlings, and the one who respected\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> the least, but after he found out that Rand was\n      the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>, he went his own way, preaching\n      of Rand&apos;s glory as the &#x201C;Lord Dragon Reborn.&#x201D;  Rand\n      dispatched <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin</a> to bring Masema back into line.\n      He was stark raving mad, and very dangerous. He even claimed that Masema\n      Dagar was dead, and that he had been resurrected as the Prophet of the\n      Dragon Reborn.  He is described as a dark, frowning man of average size\n      with a faded arrow-scar on his cheek.  He cared nothing for appearances,\n      least of all his own.  He had deep-set, almost black eyes.\n      Shortly before his death, Masema remembered his days as Masema, how he\n      had earned his sword on his thirteenth nameday,\n      but those were only a blurring memory.\n      Masema was killed by Perrin&apos;s wife <a href=\"#Faile\">Faile</a>;\n      she claimed that her duty as a wife required her to step in where\n      Perrin could not do what was necessary.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Prophet\">Prophet of the Dragon, The</a>.\n  "}]}
