She is from Shienar, and has no Warder.  Delana started to cause\n      trouble in the Hall, especially with her demand to make a\n      formal declaration that <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> is Black Ajah.  She\n      was willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters\n      would not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her\n      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of\n      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named\n      <a href=\"#Halima\">Halima</a>, and she often lent her to Egwene; Halima\n      was the only person who seemed to be able to make Egwene&apos;s headaches go\n      away.  Halima, of course, was <em>causing</em> Egwene&apos;s headaches, but\n      she was not aware of that.  Delana went pale and excused herself from\n      the Hall when <a href=\"#Narishma\">Narishma</a> reported that a woman was\n      able to channel <i>saidin</i> and then detected a someone attempting to\n      break through the ward against eavesdropping with <i>saidin</i>.\n      <a href=\"#Romanda\">Romanda</a> subsequently put two and two together,\n      and demanded Delana be arrested.  She and Halima had already left the\n      camp.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Halima\">Saranov, Halima</a>.\n  "}]}
