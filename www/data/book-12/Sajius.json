His book contains the line,\n      &#x201C;He shall hold a blade of light in his hands, and the three shall\n      become one.&#x201D;  The traditional interpretation of this line is that\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> will wield <i>Callandor</i> and unite three\n      kingdoms under him.  Min thinks, however, that this refers to the fact\n      that <i>Callandor</i> must be wielded by a circle of three&#x2014;one man\n      and two women.\n  "}]}
