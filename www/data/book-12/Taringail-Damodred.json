He died when Elayne was barely old enough\n      to remember him, which was probably fortunate for Morgase;\n      unbeknownst to her, he had planned to engineer her death and make\n      himself the first King of Andor in a millenium.\n      Gawyn has few memories of him, but remembers that he was tall and\n      handsome, with slight waves in his hair.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Damodred, Galadedrid</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Damodred, Tigraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
