She was considered weak as Amyrlin.\n      In memory of the days before the Trolloc Wars when no ruler held a\n      throne without the White Tower&apos;s approval,\n      she had a gilded clock commissioned.\n      The clock was taken down and forgotten in storage after she died, and it\n      didn&apos;t reappear until <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> put it back up when\n      she was raised.  The truth is worse than is generally known:  Cemaile&apos;s\n      tenure as Amyrlin would have been a complete disaster if the Ajah heads\n      had not intervened.
