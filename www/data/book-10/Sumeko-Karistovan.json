{"id":"Sumeko-Karistovan","name":"Sumeko Karistovan","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 11:  Talk of Debts","info":"Sumeko Karistovan,\n      p. 292 (345)—One of\n      the Kin.  She is a very Talented Healer, and has developed\n      methods of Healing that not even Nynaeve has been\n      able to develop—in fact, the only thing similar would be the\n      methods Damer Flinn has developed among the\n      Asha'man.  She is possibly the most skilled female Healer alive outside\n      of Semirhage.  She is stout, has confident\n      eyes, straight black hair, a round face, and is very imposing.\n      Unfortunately, Sumeko's abilities in Healing have caused her to\n      occasionally rise above herself—one of her gravest errors was to\n      call Nynaeve “girl.”  She now frowns on anyone who uses the\n      “traditional” form of Healing.\n  "}]}
