He\n      was killed there when Rand bested him in a\n      swordfight.  He was a Blademaster, and was quite stunned when Rand was\n      able to match him.  He kept a collection of rare cuendillar\n      objects, including (thanks in part to looting\n      Bayle Domon's ship)\n      two seals on the Dark One's\n      prison.  Both of these seals broke when the Seanchan were pushed back\n      into the sea at Falme.\n      See also\n      Meldarath, Suroth Sabelle.\n  "}]}
