{"id":"Demandred","name":"Demandred","chapters":[{"title":"Epilogue:  An AnswerGlossary","info":"Demandred,\n      p. 690 (833)—One of the Forsaken.  He has a hawk-like nose and dark hair.\n      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.  He was born Barid Bel\n      Medar one day after Lews Therin Telamon, and from\n      the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments,\n      almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never\n      surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest\n      generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred\n      believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior,\n      and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces\n      over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of\n      Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could\n      finally better Lews Therin—he believed the Shadow would eventually\n      win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and\n      that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light\n      would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he\n      transferred his hatred of Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his\n      soul, Rand al'Thor.  Demandred was recently told by\n      the Dark One to lead his plan to convert or destroy\n      Rand, and promised him to be Nae'blis if he\n      succeeded.  However, since Moridin has been declared\n      Nae'blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin.  Demandred's assumed\n      identity and whereabouts are unknown.  Note:  Demandred's identity\n      in the world is still not definite.  There are some suggestions that\n      he is one of the Tairens, or one of the Seanchan—Seanchan is\n      possible (likely, in fact), but the Tairen thing is not.  All we know\n      is that Demandred likes working through proxies.\n  "}]}
