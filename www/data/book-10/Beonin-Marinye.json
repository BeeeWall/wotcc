She is pretty, has honey-colored hair, and grew up in\n      Tarabon.   Her blue-gray eyes seem to constantly look startled.  Nothing\n      seems to surprise her, though, and <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> thinks\n      she would not believe the Sun would come up unless she saw it herself,\n      and if one morning it did not, she would just take it to confirm that\n      she was correct to demand proof.  She was one of the six sisters in\n      Salidar that had most of the authority, despite not being part of the\n      Hall of the Tower, and now serves as <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a>&apos;s\n      advisor from the Gray Ajah.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Tervail\">Dura, Tervail</a>.\n  "}]}
