She has actually been of the Black Ajah for all but five of\n      her almost ninety years wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among\n      the Black sisters.  She is now the head of the Red Ajah, and led the\n      expedition to bring <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> to Tar Valon after he was\n      shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at Dumai&apos;s\n      Wells, and is now a prisoner of <a href=\"#Sevanna\">Sevanna</a>.  Galina\n      has long black hair without a touch of gray in it.  She claims to have\n      helped break two <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin</a>&apos;s as a Black sister&#x2014;one\n      (<a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>) was deposed and stilled, and the\n      other (<a href=\"#Tamra\">Tamra Ospenya</a>) was made to appear that she\n      had died in her sleep.  She led the circle that stilled Siuan.\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Pevara</a> firmly did not want to believe that Galina\n      was Black, despite <a href=\"#Talene\">Talene</a>&apos;s suspicions that she\n      was.  When Galina&apos;s loyalties were proven, presumably by an\n      inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage\n      for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands.\n      Galina now serves Sevanna and often shares her tent.  She is pretty, but\n      nowhere near beautiful.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Talene\">Minly, Talene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tamra\">Ospenya, Tamra</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Sevanna\">Sevanna</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Pevara\">Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.\n  "}]}
