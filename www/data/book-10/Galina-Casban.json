{"id":"Galina-Casban","name":"Galina Casban","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Glimmers of the Pattern","info":"Galina Casban,\n      p. 45 (38)—Highest of the\n      Red Ajah.  She has actually been of the Black Ajah for all but five of\n      her almost ninety years wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among\n      the Black sisters.  She is now the head of the Red Ajah, and led the\n      expedition to bring Rand to Tar Valon after he was\n      shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at Dumai's\n      Wells, and is now a prisoner of Sevanna.  Galina\n      has long black hair without a touch of gray in it.  She claims to have\n      helped break two Amyrlin's as a Black sister—one\n      (Siuan Sanche) was deposed and stilled, and the\n      other (Tamra Ospenya) was made to appear that she\n      had died in her sleep.  She led the circle that stilled Siuan.\n      Pevara firmly did not want to believe that Galina\n      was Black, despite Talene's suspicions that she\n      was.  When Galina's loyalties were proven, presumably by an\n      inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage\n      for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands.\n      Galina now serves Sevanna and often shares her tent.  She is pretty, but\n      nowhere near beautiful.\n      See also\n      Minly, Talene;\n      Ospenya, Tamra;\n      Sanche, Siuan;\n      Sevanna;\n      Tazanovni, Pevara.\n  "}]}
