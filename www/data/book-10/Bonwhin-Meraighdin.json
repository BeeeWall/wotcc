She was raised from the Red Ajah, the last Amyrlin besides\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> from the Red.  She tried to use the Tower&apos;s\n      influence to manipulate Hawkwing and make him a puppet ruler of the\n      White Tower.  This ended in disaster, as Hawkwing laid seige to Tar\n      Valon and attempted to destroy the Aes Sedai stronghold&#x2014;he nearly\n      succeeded.  Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for\n      nearly destroying the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has\n      been raised.  She was succeeded by Deane Aryman of\n      the Blue Ajah, who took office after years of disorder in the Tower\n      where no Amyrlin was chosen and attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did\n      to the Tower&apos;s reputation.  Deane succeeded for the most part.\n      Unfortunately, this created extreme tension between the Red and Blue\n      Ajahs that still exists today, and is the main reason why the Red Ajah\n      will (and did) take any pretext to pull down an Amyrlin raised from the\n      Blue Ajah.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">al&apos;Vere, Egwene</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Deane\">Aryman, Deane</a>.\n  "}]}
