A square-faced man, he is dark for an Andorman.  During the\n      Succession, Jared's House opposed Morgase; after\n      she became Queen, he was only allowed into the Palace on state\n      occasions.  When Rand killed\n      Gaebril and took control of Caemlyn until he\n      could find Elayne, Jarid tried to make himself\n      fall into favor, thinking he could gain power with the new ruler.  He\n      and his wife have been exiled, and now support\n      Arymilla's claim to the Lion Throne, but if\n      Elenia attempts to claim the throne for herself, Elayne expects him to\n      assist her.  He is very honorable, almost too much so.\n  "}]}
