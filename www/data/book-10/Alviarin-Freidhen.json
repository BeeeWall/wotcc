{"id":"Alviarin-Freidhen","name":"Alviarin Freidhen","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Glimmers of the Pattern","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Alviarin\">Alviarin Freidhen</a>,\n      p. 47 (41)&#x2014;Aes Sedai\n      of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black Ajah.  She was\n      chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader was killed by\n      Ishamael after she managed to kill off the\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a> without Ishamael&apos;s approval.\n      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.\n      She serves as <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>, despite being of a different Ajah than\n      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in\n      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges\n      against <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought\n      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the\n      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose\n      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely\n      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of\n      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her power to\n      Alviarin&#x2014;and if Alviarin&apos;s loyalties are ever revealed, nothing\n      will save either of them.  Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by\n      <a href=\"#Mesaana\">Mesaana</a>, though it is unclear whether she has\n      actually used this ability yet.  She appears to know that the Aes Sedai\n      sent back from Salidar are spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with\n      <a href=\"#Meidani\">Meidani</a>, who was one of them.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>.\n  "}]}
