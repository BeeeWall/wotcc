She was raised from the Blue Ajah, and succeeded by\n      Sierin Vayu.  She was put to the Question by\n      Jarna Malari, then the head of the Black Ajah, with\n      assistance from Chesmal Emry, who made it appear\n      that she died in her sleep.  Her\n      Keeper of the Chronicles\n      was Gitara Moroso; she was one of\n      only three people present at Gitara's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the\n      Dragon.  This may be the information that Jarna\n      was trying to extract from her; it may also be the reason\n      Ishamael killed Jarna for killing Tamra.\n      See also\n      Amyrlin Seat;\n      Casban, Galina;\n      Damodred, Moiraine;\n      Sanche, Siuan.\n  "}]}
