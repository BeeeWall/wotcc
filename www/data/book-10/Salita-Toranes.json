She is from Tear, has a round face, and is almost as dark as the\n      Sea Folk.  She was raised to a Sitter after the sisters banded together\n      in Salidar.  She suggested a tax on the towns the Aes Sedai passed\n      through to raise money for the ever-growing army.

She thinks it is wrong to sell objects made from\n      <i>cuendillar</i> that they have just made recently.\n      She also thinks the Yellows are being unfairly drawn from Healing to\n      make the objects (as if her Ajah&apos;s duty was more important than that of\n      other Ajahs).\n  "}]}
