He is a good\n      horse racer, and travels with Mat and <a href=\"#Luca\">Luca</a>&apos;s show.\n      He has a certain fascination with the game Snakes and Foxes, and does\n      not seem to understand that there is no way to win without cheating.\n      <i>Note:  many people think that Olver may be the Rebirth of\n      <a href=\"#Gaidal\">Gaidal Cain</a>&#x2014;he is certainly ugly, as Gaidal\n      was, and with <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a>&apos;s viewing of\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>&apos;s adventures with an ugly man both far\n      older than her and far younger than her, it seems to fit.  Also, there\n      is speculation that Olver&apos;s obsession with Snakes and Foxes, which is\n      based on dealings with the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, will allow him (or Mat,\n      <a href=\"#Thom\">Thom</a>, or someone else who would observe his\n      solutions) to puzzle out how to beat the Eelfinn and get\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a> back from them.</i>\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Adria\">Adria</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Jameine\">Jameine</a>.\n  "}]}
