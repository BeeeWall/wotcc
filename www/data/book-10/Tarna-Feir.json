She has long, pale, yellow hair, a strong jaw, and blue\n      eyes that could freeze the Sun.  She was a wilder, and had her block\n      beaten out of her by <a href=\"#Galina\">Galina Casban</a>.  She is as\n      jumpy as a novice.  <i>Note:  Tarna says at one point that Galina\n      &#x201C;knew [her] Ajah long before [she] did, and took a personal\n      interest in [her].&#x201D;  This is just speculation, but I think it was\n      the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina knew she would choose.  It\n      certainly fits with the idea of most Aes  Sedai in the Tower being\n      Black, and with Galina&apos;s personal interest in Tarna.  Again, it&apos;s just\n      speculation....</i>\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>.\n  "}]}
