{"id":"Nicola-Treehill","name":"Nicola Treehill","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 17:  Secrets","info":"Nicola Treehill,\n      p. 429 (517)â€”Slender, black-haired, dark-eyed novice; she is about\n      Nynaeve's age.  She was a refugee from Ghealdan.\n      She has already developed several Talents, including the ability to see\n      ta'veren and Foretelling, although what she Foretells is usually\n      in such language that only poets can understand it.  Her potential\n      exceeds that of all Aes Sedai currently alive, with the exception of\n      Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve.\n      She has a limited ability to make cuendillar, but she is\n      impatient in learning.  She is very arrogant and can also be deceitful;\n      she once tried to blackmail Egwene,\n      Myrelle, and Nisao.  She\n      uses the fact that she can Foretell to be even more arrogant and demand\n      even more special treatment.\n  "}]}
