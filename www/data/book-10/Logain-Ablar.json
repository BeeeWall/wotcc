He got loose\n      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>,\n      and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and\n      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled he was of considerable\n      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his\n      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great\n      power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain later came forward with\n      information that indicated that the Red Ajah actually put him up to\n      declaring himself the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely\n      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more\n      glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.
