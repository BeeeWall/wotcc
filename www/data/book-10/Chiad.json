She is short for an Aiel\n      woman, and has blonde hair.  Gaul wants her to marry\n      him, but she will not give up the spear.  She is willing to be his\n      lover, but marriage is out of the question (or so she says).  She is\n      first-sister to Bain, and the two served as a sort\n      of honor guard for Faile.  She and Bain were\n      captured along with Faile by the Shaido and made gai'shain.  She\n      has refused Faile's offer of escape once her plan is ready; she vows to\n      serve her year and a day, as prescribed by ji'e'toh, and then\n      walk away.\n      See also\n      Bain;\n      Gaul.\n  "}]}
