Not young, but pretty.  She is\n      Toram Riatin's sister, and will do anything\n      for him if he asked her to.  She is also the daughter of\n      King Galldrian.  She is tall for a Cairhienin\n      woman (and only for a Cairhienin woman...).  She had pledged for\n      Rand, but disappeared after the attack by Asha'man.\n      The last Rand saw her, she was bound with the Power under a bed.  Since\n      Toram is assumed dead, she is being pressured to assume the High Seat of\n      House Riatin.\n      See also\n      Riatin, Toram.\n  "}]}
