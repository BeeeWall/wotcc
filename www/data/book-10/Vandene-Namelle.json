Their\n      goal was some day to write the complete history of the World since the\n      Breaking, and some even before that.  They were both summoned back\n      early, however, and they later came to Salidar to escape\n      Elaida's summons back to the Tower.  Vandene is\n      now in Caemlyn, and has been joy-less since Adeleas's murder.  She is\n      slender, and has white hair.\n      See also\n      Namelle, Adeleas.\n  "}]}
