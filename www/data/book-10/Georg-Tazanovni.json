He was twelve\n      when he was murdered by Darkfriends in an uprising that also killed the\n      rest of Pevara's family.  He was beautiful, tall for his age, and\n      fearless.  He died with a knife in his hand, standing over his father's\n      body, trying to keep the mob away from his mother.  He would be long\n      dead, with or without the Darkfriend mob, as would his\n      great-grandchildren, but his death and the deaths of the rest of her\n      family still haunt Pevara to this day.\nChapter 23:  Ornaments\n\n  "}]}
