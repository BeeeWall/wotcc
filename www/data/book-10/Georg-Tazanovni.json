He was twelve\n      when he was murdered by Darkfriends in an uprising that also killed the\n      rest of Pevara&apos;s family.  He was beautiful, tall for his age, and\n      fearless.  He died with a knife in his hand, standing over his father&apos;s\n      body, trying to keep the mob away from his mother.  He would be long\n      dead, with or without the Darkfriend mob, as would his\n      great-grandchildren, but his death and the deaths of the rest of her\n      family still haunt Pevara to this day.\n\n\n  "}]}
