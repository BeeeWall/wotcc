{"id":"Jahar-Narishma","name":"Jahar Narishma","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Glimmers of the Pattern","info":"Jahar Narishma,\n      p. 85 (88)—A man not\n      much past twenty that had the spark of saidin inborn.  He is now\n      one of the Asha'man.  He is loyal to Rand, not\n      Taim.  Since being placed on the Traitor's List, he\n      has been in hiding—he did not assist in the attack on Rand, but\n      Rand thinks it better to be safe than have him killed.  He has since\n      been bonded as a Warder by Merise.  He wielded\n      Callandor at the cleansing of saidin, though the circle\n      was controlled by one of the women.  Merise took away\n      his dragon pin, claiming it was not appropriate for him to wear it in\n      lieu of his new responsibilites as her Warder—Jahar was very angry\n      with her for this, and she will eventually have to learn that he is\n      much stronger than she is, and she needs to give him respect appropriate\n      to that position.\n      See also\n      Haindehl, Merise.\n  "}]}
