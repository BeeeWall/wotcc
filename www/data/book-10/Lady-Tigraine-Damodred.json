She was the\n      Daughter-Heir to the Throne of Andor and daughter of\n      Queen Mordrellen, but she disappeared.  Her\n      disappearance set of the Third War of Andoran Succession.  When\n      Rand was in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, several\n      people commented on his striking resemblance to Tigraine; this is no\n      coincidence, since Tigraine is Rand's mother.  She fled to the Aiel\n      Waste upon a warning from Gitara Moroso to become\n      a Maiden of the Spear, and gave birth to Rand when the Aiel were\n      fighting near Tar Valon.  Her maiden name was Mantear.\n      See also\n      al'Thor, Rand;\n      Damodred, Galadedrid.\n  "}]}
