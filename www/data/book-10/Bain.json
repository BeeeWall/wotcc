She has\n      flame-colored hair.  She is first-sister to Chiad,\n      of the Goshien Aiel; the two had to sneak through the camp of the other\n      to find the Wise Ones to become first sisters, since their clans were in\n      blood feud at the time.  She later became one of the Maidens who\n      accompanied Faile, a similar honor guard to what\n      Rand has, although smaller and for different\n      reasons.  She and Chiad were both captured by the Shaido along with the\n      rest of Faile's company, and made gai'shain.  She has refused\n      Faile's offer of escape once her plan is ready; she vows to serve her\n      year and a day, as prescribed by ji'e'toh, and then walk\n      away.\n      See also\n      Chiad.\n  "}]}
