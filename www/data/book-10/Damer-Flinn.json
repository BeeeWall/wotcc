He is bald with a fringe of\n      white hair around the edge of his head.  He was in the Queen's Guards\n      until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired\n      to help people with injuries.  He came for the amnesty to see if he\n      could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has\n      developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of\n      Legends.  He managed to partially Heal Rand's wound\n      in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does\n      not seep into it anymore.  Since he was placed on\n      Taim's Traitors' List, he has been in hiding—he did\n      not assist in the attack on Rand, but Rand thinks it\n      better to be safe than to have him killed.  He has since been bonded as\n      Warder to Corele, and has been attempting to\n      teach Samitsu to do with saidar what he\n      does with saidin.\n      See also\n      Hovian, Corele;\n      Tamagowa, Samitsu.\n  "}]}
