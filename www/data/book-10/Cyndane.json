Her name means &#x201C;Last\n      Chance&#x201D; in the Old Tongue.  She is stronger in the One Power than\n      <a href=\"#Graendal\">Graendal</a>, but not as strong as\n      Lanfear used to be.  She is actually Lanfear\n      reincarnated.  <i>Note:  It is my speculation that Lanfear was somehow\n      weakened in the One Power after leaving the land of the Eelfinn.  When\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Mat</a> went there, his last wish was to get out of\n      there; if hers was not, she may have died there, and they took both her\n      life and some of her strength from her as a price.</i>\n  "}]}
