She is from Shienar, and has no Warder.  Lately, Delana has been\n      causing trouble in the Hall, especially with her demands to make a\n      formal declaration that Elaida is Black Ajah.  She\n      is willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters\n      will not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her\n      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of\n      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named\n      Halima, and she often lends her to Egwene; Halima\n      is the only person who seems to be able to make Egwene's headaches go\n      away.\n      See also\n      Saranov, Halima.\n  "}]}
