She is actually\n      Delana's maid, but she lends her to Egwene at\n      night to help with her chronic headaches.  Since she is actually\n      Aran'gar, a reincarnated Forsaken who channels\n      saidin despite being female; it is likely that she is\n      causing Egwene's headaches, and then making them subside, in\n      order to keep her close to Egwene.  She usually sleeps on a pallet in\n      Egwene's tent.  She is stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a\n      perfect face and a full, firm bosom.  As she is posing as a poorly\n      educated serving girl, she forms her letters with the awkwardness of a\n      young child.  She has developed a fondness for low-cut bodices.\n  "}]}
