He is <i>ta&apos;veren</i>.  Along with his good\n      friends, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Perrin Aybara</a>,\n      he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after\n      Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar\n      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried\n      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai\n      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These\n      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the\n      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead\n      medallion that protects him from women&apos;s channeling, a way out of the\n      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the\n      gaps in his memory.  Mat&apos;s <i>ta&apos;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves\n      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&#x2014;he almost\n      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has\n      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his\n      newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite\n      decisively.  He has four sisters, including Eldrin\n      and <a href=\"#Bode\">Bodewhin</a>, who are 16 and 17, respectively.  His\n      father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two\n      Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying\n      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&#x2014;his\n      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named\n      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was\n      not the <a href=\"#9Moons\">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is\n      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill\n      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill\n      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar\n      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&#x2014;which was\n      also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &#x201C;to\n      die and live again.&#x201D;  He created an army called the Band of the\n      Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old\n      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand&apos;s personal general&#x2014;this\n      worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even\n      <a href=\"#Bashere\">Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his reputation as\n      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and\n      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a\n      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> and <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> and\n      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there he was\n      cornered by <a href=\"#Tylin\">Queen Tylin</a>, who gave him little choice\n      but to become her lover.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle\n      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so\n      it looked &#x201C;official&#x201D;&#x2014;Tylin was found torn limb from\n      limb, obviously by the <i>gholam</i> which was no doubt sent to kill\n      Mat.  In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <i>sul&apos;dam</i>\n      and <i>damane</i> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and\n      even kidnapped <a href=\"#Tuon\">Tuon</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#9Moons\">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a> herself.\n      Mat is traveling with <a href=\"#Luca\">Valan Luca</a>&apos;s show now,\n      to keep out of Seanchan sight.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Perrin\">Aybara, Perrin t&apos;Bashere</a>;\n      <a href=\"#9Moons\">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tylin\">Mitsobar, Tylin Quintara</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tuon\">Paendrag, Tuon Athaem Kore</a>.\n  "}]}
