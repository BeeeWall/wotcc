{"id":"Lord-Captain-Commander-Eamon-Valda","name":"Lord Captain Commander Eamon Valda","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Glimmers of the Pattern","info":"Lord Captain Commander Eamon Valda,\n      p. 27 (16)—Lord\n      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light after the death of\n      Pedron Niall.  He killed Niall's assassin shortly\n      after the act, but it is not known whether this was set up, or whether\n      Valda just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  One of\n      his first acts was to dismiss Niall's secretary,\n      Sebban Balwer, for “someone who didn't\n      twitch”—this was a mistake, as Balwer was Niall's\n      true Master of Spies—he knows more about spying than anyone\n      else in the world.  Valda offered assistance to Morgase, as\n      Niall had promised, but before doing so he required a\n      “service” of her—to share his bed.  Morgase escaped\n      during the Seanchan attack, and Valda believes her to be dead.\n      See also\n      Asunawa, Rhadam;\n      Balwer, Sebban;\n      Niall, Pedron.\n  "}]}
