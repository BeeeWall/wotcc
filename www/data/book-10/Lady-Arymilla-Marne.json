She opposed\n      Morgase during the Succession.  The only real\n      reason Rand kept her around in Caemlyn was to push\n      others into supporting Dyelin; no one wanted Andor\n      in the hands of Arymilla.  Once Elayne returned to\n      Andor, she exiled Arymilla as her mother had.  However, Arymilla learned\n      of where Naean and Elenia\n      were being detained in Murandy and rescued them.  This debt of sorts\n      bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support Arymilla's claim to the\n      Lion Throne.  She now has the support of five major houses of Andor.\n      She is plump, verging on stout, has a vacuous smile, and brown eyes that\n      are almost always wide with interest.  Her sign is four silver moons on\n      a twilight blue field.\n      See also\n      Arawn, Naean;\n      Sarand, Elenia.\n  "}]}
