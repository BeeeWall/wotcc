She opposed\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  The only real\n      reason <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> kept her around in Caemlyn was to push\n      others into supporting <a href=\"#Dyelin\">Dyelin</a>; no one wanted Andor\n      in the hands of Arymilla.  Once <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a> returned to\n      Andor, she exiled Arymilla as her mother had.  However, Arymilla learned\n      of where <a href=\"#Naean\">Naean</a> and <a href=\"#Elenia\">Elenia</a>\n      were being detained in Murandy and rescued them.  This debt of sorts\n      bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support Arymilla&apos;s claim to the\n      Lion Throne.  She now has the support of five major houses of Andor.\n      She is plump, verging on stout, has a vacuous smile, and brown eyes that\n      are almost always wide with interest.  Her sign is four silver moons on\n      a twilight blue field.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Naean\">Arawn, Naean</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elenia\">Sarand, Elenia</a>.\n  "}]}
