It is said they are\n      married, and Greens who marry seldom take more than one Warder.  She\n      left him in Cairhien, but he has followed her to Tear.  He is tall,\n      lean, and pretty with pale hair, and has a harsh voice.  She has spent\n      the past twenty years convincing everyone else that they were married so\n      no one would be suspicious of them being alone together.  He likes\n      killing.  <i>Editor&apos;s note:  It is not revealed whether Fearil knows\n      that Elza is Black Ajah, but since we are told he likes killing, it only\n      makes sense that he does.</i>\n\n\n  "}]}
