A\n      Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>\n      and narrowed it to three boys in Emond&apos;s Field.\n      While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of\n      Mordeth in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.\n      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul, but instead the two souls\n      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain\n      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.\n      It is said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&#x201D; from\n      observing that a Myrddraal&apos;s look causes fear in the hearts of men.\n      Fain&apos;s look has that effect on Myrddraal&#x2014;Fades feel the same fear\n      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called\n      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak\n      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He now served for a\n      time as advisor to <a href=\"#Toram\">Toram Riatin</a>, one of the\n      Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>.  Rand has a bounty\n      of 100,000 gold crowns on his head&#x2014;Fain killed Rand&apos;s friends\n      because they were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because\n      it was his homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it.  In\n      addition, <a href=\"#Moridin\">Moridin</a> is now hunting Fain, although\n      indirectly&#x2014;he sent Isam (alias\n      Slayer) to kill him.\n  "}]}
