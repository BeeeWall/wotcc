When Egeanin found\n      her, she tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the a'dam she was\n      carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier to the\n      woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the\n      a'dam should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring\n      around her head).  Much to Egeanin's surprise, the a'dam held\n      Bethamin just as well as it held the damane it was intended for.\n      Bethamin already knew this, from observing Renna, who\n      Egwene left collared after Falme.  From this, and\n      from Nynaeve's and Elayne's\n      information about the possibility of learning to channel (not just\n      having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that all sul'dam, including\n      Bethamin, could channel if they were taught—which went against\n      everything she had been taught her entire life.  Bethamin is now\n      forbidden to be linked to damane, both as protection for\n      her—if anyone besides Suroth knew that the\n      a'dam would control her, they would probably make her wear it all\n      the time—and as protection for the Seanchan way of life, which\n      would likely collapse if it was learned that sul'dam could\n      channel just as well as damane.  She has since been spirited away\n      from Ebou Dar with Mat, Egeanin, and the rest of the group\n      that fled Ebou Dar.\n      See also\n      Emain, Renna;\n      Zarbey, Seta.\n  "}]}
