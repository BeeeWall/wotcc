She has raven-black hair\n      winged with white, and is about a head taller than her husband\n      Davram, the Marshal-General of Saldaea.  She was\n      stabbed by a man while he was ransacking her tent, but she is alive.\n      She and Davram rarely yell, but they have a very upfront method of\n      conversing with each other that often makes others somewhat\n      uncomfortable.  She did not approve of her daughter&apos;s marriage at first,\n      but was eventually convinced to accept it.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Faile\">t&apos;Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Bashere\">Davram t&apos;Ghaline Bashere</a>.\n  "}]}
