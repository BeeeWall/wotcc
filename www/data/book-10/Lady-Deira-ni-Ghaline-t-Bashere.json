She has raven-black hair\n      winged with white, and is about a head taller than her husband\n      Davram, the Marshal-General of Saldaea.  She was\n      stabbed by a man while he was ransacking her tent, but she is alive.\n      She and Davram rarely yell, but they have a very upfront method of\n      conversing with each other that often makes others somewhat\n      uncomfortable.  She did not approve of her daughter's marriage at first,\n      but was eventually convinced to accept it.\n      See also\n      t'Aybara, Faile ni Bashere;\n      Davram t'Ghaline Bashere.\n  "}]}
