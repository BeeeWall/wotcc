When she became a Hunter,\n      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the\n      name “Mandarb”—she chose Faile when she found that\n      Mandarb was the name of Lan's\n      horse.  She fell in love with Perrin Aybara while\n      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.\n      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that\n      Rand was the Dragon Reborn and\n      that both he and Perrin are ta'veren.  Faile stayed near Perrin,\n      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off\n      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were\n      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,\n      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which\n      she trained herself.  Her name means “falcon” in the Old\n      Tongue; she is the falcon in Min's viewings of\n      Perrin.  She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she\n      can to make sure he not so much as looks at another woman, even\n      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,\n      especially toward people like Berelain who eye\n      her husband all the time.  She even cornered Min when\n      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure\n      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to\n      find Masema, and while he was away her party was\n      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken gai'shain by them.\n      She and the servants captured with her are planning an escape.  She is\n      now a personal servant of Sevanna, and she\n      seems to be one of Sevanna's favorites.\n      See also\n      Aybara, Perrin t'Bashere;\n      t'Bashere, Deira ni Ghaline;\n      Davram t'Ghaline Bashere.\n  "}]}
