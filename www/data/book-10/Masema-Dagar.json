He was once one of\n      Uno's underlings, and the one who respected\n      Rand the least, but after he found out that Rand was\n      the Dragon Reborn, he went his own way, preaching\n      of Rand's glory as the “Lord Dragon Reborn.”  Rand has since\n      dispatched Perrin to bring Masema back into line.\n      He is stark raving mad, and very dangerous.  He even claims that Masema\n      Dagar is dead, and that he has been resurrected as the Prophet of the\n      Dragon Reborn.

He has deep-set, almost black eyes.\n      See also\n      Prophet of the Dragon, The.\n  "}]}
