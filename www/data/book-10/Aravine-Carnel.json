She was weary-eyed and resigned the first day\n      Faile met her, when she gave Faile her golden belt\n      signifying service to Sevanna.  Her time as\n      gai'shain has toughened her a lot.  She was the one who took\n      Faile to see that Arrela and\n      Lacile had been captured, then led her to\n      Sevanna for her own punishment.  Before leaving her with Sevanna,\n      however, she swore fealty to Faile, using Faile's new last name.\n      She knows Faile plans to escape, and wants to help—provided\n      she can escape as well.  She was once a noble, it appears.\nChapter 10:  A Blazing Beacon\n\n  "}]}
