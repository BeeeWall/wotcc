Her time as\n      <i>gai&apos;shain</i> has toughened her a lot.  She was the one who took\n      Faile to see that <a href=\"#Arrela\">Arrela</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Lacile\">Lacile</a> had been captured, then led her to\n      Sevanna for her own punishment.  Before leaving her with Sevanna,\n      however, she swore fealty to Faile, using Faile&apos;s new last name.\n      She knows Faile plans to escape, and wants to help&#x2014;provided\n      she can escape as well.  She was once a noble, it appears.\n\n\n  "}]}
