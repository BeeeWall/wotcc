To protect the Seanchan\n      way of life—which would likely collapse if it was learned that\n      sul'dam could learn to channel—Seta retains her rank as\n      sul'dam, but is forbidden to be linked with a damane.\n      She was kept under close watch by Suroth.  She has\n      since been taken along with Mat and the others that\n      left Ebou Dar.\n  "}]}
