{"id":"Anaiya","name":"Anaiya","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 16:  The Subject of Negotiations","info":"Anaiya,\n      p. 398 (477)—Aes Sedai of the\n      Blue  Ajah.  She has blunt, motherly facial features.  She was very good\n      friends with Moiraine both as a novice and as a\n      full sister.  She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when\n      Elaida was raised to the Striped Stole, and now\n      carries a position of considerable influence in the “Little\n      Tower” in exile from Tar Valon.  She dresses very simply, and very\n      little upsets her.  She was Aes Sedai for 50 or 60 years before\n      Kairen came to the Tower.\n      See also\n      Setagana.\n  "}]}
