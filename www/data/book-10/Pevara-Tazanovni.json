She is short for a Kandori, and\n      quite plump, but tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly\n      say that Warders would make a Red sister's job easier.  She and her\n      friend since novicehood,\n      Seaine, began a hunt for Darkfriends in the\n      Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends, but\n      because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends when she was young.\n      She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved being\n      outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be able to\n      find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family and\n      others like them.  She now leads the organization of sisters in the\n      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with\n      Saerin Sedai, who seized control away from\n      Seaine as soon as she knew what they were about.\n      See also\n      Asnobar, Saerin;\n      Herimon, Seaine;\n      Tazanovni, Georg.\n  "}]}
