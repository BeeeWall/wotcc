{"id":"Shemari","name":"Shemari","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 17:  Secrets","info":"Shemari,\n      p. 421 (507)—Aes Sedai of\n      the Brown Ajah.  Neither she nor Phaedrine is\n      strong enough to weave a gateway by herself, but linked they can just\n      barely manage one big enough to walk through.  She instructed\n      Egwene when Egwene was a novice in the White\n      Tower.  She is vigorous, and square-faced—she looks more like a\n      Green than a Tower librarian—and she is always far beyond\n      proper.  Her deep curtsies to Egwene usually suggest mockery, and she\n      has been known to curtsy from over a hundred paces away.\n  "}]}
