None of her\n      sons lived past age twenty, hence the tradition of only having a queen\n      in Andor.  Her parents were <a href=\"#Endara\">Endara Casalain</a>,\n      the governor of the province of Andor under Artur Hawkwing, and\n      <a href=\"#Joal\">Joal Ramedar</a>, the last king of Aldeshar.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Endara\">Casalain, Endara</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Souran\">Maravaile, Souran</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Joal\">Ramedar, Joal</a>.\n  "}]}
