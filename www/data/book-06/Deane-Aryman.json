Her strong spirit and sturdy\n      administration brought the Tower back to most of its former prestige, all\n      of which was teetering on the brink of disappearing after Bonwhin&apos;s\n      manipulations of Hawkwing.  She in effect saved the Tower.  She is one of\n      the most respected Amyrlins of all time, and part of the reason a large\n      number of Amyrlins have been raised from the Blue Ajah.  She was born in\n      the city of Salidar, in Eharon.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>.\n  "}]}
