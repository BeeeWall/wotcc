His first wife, <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Tigraine</a>,\n      the then Daughter-Heir of Andor, bore him a son,\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a>, before she vanished, causing the War of\n      Succession.  After the war was over, he married\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase Trakand</a>, the new Queen.  Taringail and\n      Morgase had two children, <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.  He died when Elayne was barely old enough\n      to remember him, which was probably fortunate for Morgase; unbeknownst to\n      her, he had planned to engineer her death and make himself the first King\n      of Andor in a millenium.  His real dream was to see his son sit on the\n      Sun Throne of Cairhien and his daughter sit on the Lion Throne of\n      Andor.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Damodred, Galadedrid</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Damodred, Tigraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
