Hearing of\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>&apos;s amnesty, Taim came to Caemlyn and became the\n      head of Rand&apos;s school of male channelers.

Taim claims to have held off the madness that\n      normally accompanies the taint for almost 35 years&#x2014;he has been\n      using the One Power for a very long time, and knows many tricks that\n      Rand had not thought of on his own or been taught by\n      <a href=\"#Asmodean\">Asmodean</a>, such as how to test men for the\n      ability.  He seems to resent being second to Rand.  <i>Editor&apos;s Note:\n      There has been an ongoing debate on-line about whether\n      <a href=\"#Demandred\">Demandred</a> had comandeered Taim&apos;s identity and\n      was trying to bring Rand down by taking away support from men who can\n      channel and making them loyal to him alone.
