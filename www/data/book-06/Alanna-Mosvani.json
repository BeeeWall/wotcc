She\n      later found that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it\n      impossible to compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it\n      to attempting to uproot a tree with her bare hands), but she constantly\n      feels the pain he experiences from the wound in his side, perhaps even\n      more severely than he feels it.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Ihvon\">Ihvon</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Owein\">Owein</a>.\n  "}]}
