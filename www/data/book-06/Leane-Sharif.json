Just as her family\n      members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani women, Leane\n      found that her life would take a different direction; she could channel\n      <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.  She became an\n      Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup led by\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Alviarin\">Alviarin Freidhen</a> that deposed Siuan,\n      Leane was thrown in the dungeon and\n      stilled.  Leane has turned to her seductive side to try to replace what\n      she lost in stilling; she is out of practice, but does well enough.  She\n      eventually convinced the Aes Sedai in Salidar to let her stay with them\n      and maintain the network of eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as\n      Keeper.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Anjen\">Anjen</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Alviarin\">Freidhen, Alviarin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>.\n  "}]}
