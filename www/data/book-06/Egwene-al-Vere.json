She\n      has considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be\n      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  It is also\n      thought that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500\n      years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.\n      Egwene is good friends with <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne Trakand</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#DH\">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, and is also a childhood friend\n      of <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn.\n      In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth,\n      but both of them feels an almost sibling-like love for each other now;\n      they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to.\n      Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers,\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a> and <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a>&#x2014;she is\n      flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but she does not return them;\n      she does find Gawyn to her liking.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">al&apos;Meara, Nynaeve</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Damodred, Galadedrid</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>.\n  "}]}
