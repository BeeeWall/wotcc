He is a swordsman, and\n      is always linked to <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a> in the stories.\n      Unlike his depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as\n      Birgitte is beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a> has ever seen.  Just being around him\n      makes Nynaeve uncomfortable.  Before being ripped out of\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, Birgitte mentioned that she had not seen Gaidal\n      around for some time, indicating that he has been spun out into the\n      Pattern again.
