Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for\n      herself, which means &#x201C;Daughter of the Night&#x201D; in the Old\n      Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile, and\n      was strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary\n      facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery there was\n      what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be\n      harnessed by men and women alike&#x2014;this source turned out to be the\n      emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the\n      <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a>&apos;s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named\n      Beidomon bored into that prison, creating what is now referred to as\n      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and\n      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin had a\n      relationship with <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed\n      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and\n      influential man she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship\n      when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and\n      the possibility of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go\n      of him, and when he later met and married\n      <a href=\"#Ilyena\">Ilyena Moerelle</a>\n      she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split\n      the two apart by any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to\n      dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to get back at Lews Therin\n      for leaving her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,\n      <i>Tel&apos;aran&apos;rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred\n      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin&apos;s soul&apos;s new body,\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.  She\n      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, disguising her\n      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.\n      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been\n      &#x201C;unfaithful&#x201D; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she\n      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway\n      <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine</a>, and became trapped.  It is not known\n      whether Lanfear is still alive.\n  "}]}
