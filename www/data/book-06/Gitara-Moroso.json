One of her Foretellings was\n      to tell <a href=\"#Tigraine\">Tigraine</a> that she must become a Maiden of\n      the Spear, or dire consequences would result; as it turned out, Tigraine\n      needed to become <a href=\"#Shaiel\">Shaiel</a>, the Maiden of the Spear\n      who bore a son by <a href=\"#Janduin\">Janduin</a> that grew up to be\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>.\n      Another concerned Tigraine&apos;s brother <a href=\"#Luc\">Luc</a>;\n      she told him his fame, or his fate, lay in the Blight; he went into the\n      Blight, and was never seen again.
