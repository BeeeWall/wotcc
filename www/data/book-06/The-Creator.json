The Creator is bent\n      on non-interference&#x2014;He will not directly influence events in the\n      world, instead using a &#x201C;Chosen One&#x201D; or simply tugging at the\n      Pattern of the Age in hopes that what He wants to occur will occur,\n      instead of just making it happen.  The Forsaken and most Darkfriends\n      consider Him to be inferior to the Dark One, despite the fact that He\n      imprisoned him.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon, The</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Dark\">Shai&apos;tan</a>.\n  "}]}
