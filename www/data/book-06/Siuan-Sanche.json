As a novice, she was good friends with\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and was present at\n      <a href=\"#Gitara\">Gitara Moroso</a>&apos;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the\n      <a href=\"#Dragon\">Dragon</a>.  After being raised to the shawl, she\n      joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a>, and eventually came\n      to lead the Blues&apos; network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being\n      raised to the <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was only thirty\n      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest\n      Amyrlin to date.  When her lifelong connection to the\n      <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane Sharif</a>,\n      were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a>.  Siuan hopes to regain some of\n      her previous standing in the new Tower that has separated from\n      Elaida&#x2014;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to\n      match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of\n      her viewings, <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to remain\n      close by to <a href=\"#Bryne\">Gareth Bryne</a>&#x2014;if she did not, both\n      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now\n      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the\n      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named <a href=\"#Alric\">Alric</a>, but he\n      died when she was deposed.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Alric\">Alric</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gitara\">Moroso, Gitara</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Sharif, Leane</a>.\n  "}]}
