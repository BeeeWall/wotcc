She has a special ability that\n      few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around\n      people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their\n      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when\n      she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when.\n      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included\n      herself:  he is destined to fall in love with three different women, one\n      of which is herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men;\n      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a\n      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she\n      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon\n      helping <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan</a> with her viewings&apos; information when\n      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane</a> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two\n      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for\n      Caemlyn with Salidar&apos;s embassy to Rand.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Jan\">Jan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Miren\">Miren</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Rana\">Rana</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>.\n  "}]}
