He was appointed to the\n      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled\n      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase&apos;s new advisor,\n      <a href=\"#Gaebril\">Lord Gaebril</a>.  He moved to his private estates\n      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women\n      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>, the former\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane Sharif</a>, the former\n      <a href=\"#Keeper\">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, and\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Min Farshaw</a>.  When these three made an oath to serve\n      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer\n      curiosity to Salidar.  Once their, he discovered the true identity of\n      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in\n      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the\n      Amyrlin Seat from <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a>, since he was the only\n      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help\n      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel\n      Waste, in a league with <a href=\"#Niall\">Pedron Niall</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Rodel\">Rodel Ituralde</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Bashere\">Davram Bashere</a>,\n      <a href=\"#Agelmar\">Agelmar Jagad</a>, and\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Matrim Cauthon</a>.  Although neither of them would admit\n      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to\n      avoid another mistake like his relationship as\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Morgase</a>&apos;s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for\n      when she publicly shamed him years ago.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Siuan\">Sanche, Siuan</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
