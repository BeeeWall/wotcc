It is the last surviving Chora\n      tree, and is located in Rhuidean.  The Tree was severely damaged\n      when <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> and <a href=\"#Asmodean\">Asmodean</a>\n      battled over control of the <i>ter&apos;angreal</i> statue and destroyed\n      the shielding on Rhuidean, but it is still alive and will send out\n      shoots again.  A cutling of the Tree was given to the people of\n      Cairhien as a sign of goodwill from the Aiel over 500 years ago.  That\n      Tree, <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i>, grew in the center of\n      the city of Cairhien until <a href=\"#Laman\">King Laman Damodred</a> cut\n      it down to make a throne out of the wood.  Laman&apos;s Sin (as it is now\n      called) brought four Aiel clans over the Spine of the World to kill\n      Laman for killing the Tree.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i>;\n      <a href=\"#Laman\">Damodred, Laman</a>.\n  "}]}
