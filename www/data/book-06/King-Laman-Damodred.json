His cutting of\n      <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i> to make a throne unlike\n      anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War.  The war\n      continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even\n      Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed\n      Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman&apos;s Pride, and his Sin, House\n      Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never\n      again reached any of its former glory.  However, it also allowed\n      Prophecy to be fulfilled: the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a> was\n      able to be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of a Maiden of the\n      Spear but raised by the blood of the old nations.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <i><a href=\"#Aven\">Avendesora</a></i>;\n      <i><a href=\"#Avendo\">Avendoraldera</a></i>;\n      <a href=\"#Barthanes\">Damodred, Barthanes</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Caraline\">Damodred, Caraline</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Moiraine\">Damodred, Moiraine</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Damodred, Taringail</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Janduin\">Janduin</a>.\n  "}]}
