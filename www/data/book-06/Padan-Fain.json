A Darkfriend, he was\n      given orders to locate the <a href=\"#Reborn\">Dragon Reborn</a> and\n      narrowed it to three boys in Emond&apos;s Field.  While persuing them, he\n      encountered the spirit of <a href=\"#Mordeth\">Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now\n      called Shadar Logoth.  Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&apos;s soul, but\n      instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either\n      of them alone.  Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has\n      his own evil agenda.  He has used his Mordeth-derived powers to spread\n      suspicion of <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a> to\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida a&apos;Roihan</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>\n      in Tar Valon, and <a href=\"#Niall\">Pedron Niall</a>, Lord\n      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light.  <!-- Page 408, LoC -->\n      It is said, &#x201C;The look of the Eyeless is\n      fear,&#x201D; from observing that a Myrddraal&apos;s look causes fear in the\n      hearts of men.  Fain&apos;s look has that effect on Myrddraal&#x2014;Fades\n      feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called\n      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak\n      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Mordeth\">Mordeth</a>.\n  "}]}
