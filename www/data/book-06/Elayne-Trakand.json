She is the daughter of <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a>\n      and her late husband, <a href=\"#Taringail\">Taringail</a>, and sister to\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a>.  She is also half-sister to\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Galad</a>, although she would rather not be reminded of\n      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not\n      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and\n      will most likely be the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,\n      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exception of\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene</a> and <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve</a>.  She has\n      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne\n      realized she loved <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and told him how she\n      felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what\n      <a href=\"#Min\">Min</a> meant about &#x201C;having to share him,&#x201D; but\n      now knows about Min&apos;s viewing of Rand with the three women&apos;s heads,\n      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and\n      <a href=\"#Aviendha\">Aviendha</a>, and they with him.  Later, when she and\n      Nynaeve had trouble with <a href=\"#Moghedien\">Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended\n      up bonding <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being\n      only Accepted) in order to save Birgitte&apos;s life.  Elayne is currently\n      with the Aes Sedai in Salidar.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Birgitte\">Birgitte</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Galad\">Damodred, Galadedrid</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Taringail\">Damodred, Taringail</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Dyelin\">Taravin, Dyelin</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Morgase\">Trakand, Morgase</a>.\n  "}]}
