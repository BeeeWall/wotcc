He was the first of the Forsaken to be\n      released from the sealing.  He was trapped very close to the surface of\n      the Bore, and thus not shielded very effectively from the passage of\n      time; he emerged so deformed by age that he had to hide his face behind\n      a cloth and unable to speak with his own tongue.  He was killed by the\n      Green Man at the Eye of the\n      World.  Unknown to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Balthamel\n      has been reincarnated in the body of a young Borderlander woman.  She\n      is now called <a href=\"#Arangar\">Aran&apos;gar</a>.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Arangar\">Aran&apos;gar</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Halima\">Saranov, Halima</a>.\n  "}]}
