He was the youngest clan\n      chief of the Taardad Aiel in memory.  He ended the blood feud between\n      the Taardad and Nakai clans after over 200 years of fighting, and then\n      allied not only with the Nakai, but with the Reyn Aiel as well (who were\n      not much better than blood enemies before the alliance was made).
