During the Age of Legends, he was one of\n      the foremost biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went\n      over to the Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments\n      he wanted to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar,\n      <i>gholam</i>, Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other\n      Forsaken think he was insane, for only someone insane would create some\n      of the creatures he did.  He was the second one to be released from\n      the sealing on the Bore, after Balthamel.\n      He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded\n      from the passing of time very effectively; he emerged as a very old man,\n      so old that his face was wrinkled so that one could barely make out his\n      features anymore.  He was killed by <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> at the Eye\n      of the World.  Unbeknownst to almost everyone (including the Forsaken),\n      Aginor has been reincarnated in the body of a Borderlander man.  He is\n      now called <a href=\"#Osangar\">Osan&apos;gar</a>.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Osangar\">Osan&apos;gar</a>.\n  "}]}
