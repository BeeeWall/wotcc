She has held her chair in the Hall\n      for forty years.  Everyone knows to be wary of her temper.  She was born\n      the daughter of an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of\n      Silence (an organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than\n      the Kin)&#x2014;she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl.\n  "}]}
