He has a hawk-like nose and dark hair.\n      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.  He was born Barid Bel\n      Medar one day after <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, and from\n      the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin&apos;s accomplishments,\n      almost equal Lews Therin&apos;s strength, and almost equal him but never\n      surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light&apos;s greatest\n      generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred\n      believed that he was Lews Therin&apos;s intellectual and military superior,\n      and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light&apos;s forces\n      over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of\n      Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could\n      finally better Lews Therin&#x2014;he believed the Shadow would eventually\n      win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light&apos;s armies, and\n      that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light\n      would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he\n      transferred his hatred of Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his\n      soul, <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>.  Demandred was recently told by\n      the <a href=\"#Dark\">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to convert or destroy\n      Rand, and promised him to be <a href=\"#Naeblis\">Nae&apos;blis</a> if he\n      succeeded.  However, since <a href=\"#Moridin\">Moridin</a> has been declared\n      Nae&apos;blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin.  Demandred&apos;s assumed\n      identity and whereabouts are unknown.\n  "}]}
