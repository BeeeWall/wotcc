She was friends with\n      <a href=\"#Seaine\">Seaine</a> as a novice; the two maintained the\n      friendship, although it was a bit restrained due to the constraints that\n      the Red Ajah puts on its members about making friends outside the Ajah.\n      She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump.  She has dark eyes.  She\n      was once punished for voicing her desire to have a Warder; later, as a\n      Sitter, when she was safer from the wrath of the Ajah, she openly\n      suggested that Warders would make the job of a Red sister much easier.\n      Seaine thinks she would have been happier as a Green.  When she was\n      small, many members of her family were killed by Darkfriends; it is for\n      this reason that Seaine confides in her about searching for Darkfriends\n      in the White Tower, as well as the reason she chose the Red Ajah; she\n      thought it would be the way surest to let her hunt down Darkfriends.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Seaine\">Herimon, Seaine</a>.\n  "}]}
