She has considerable strength with the One Power,\n      and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over\n      a thousand years.  She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost\n      500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.\n      Egwene is good friends with <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne Trakand</a>, the\n      <a href=\"#DH\">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, and is also a childhood friend\n      of <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn.  In fact, Rand\n      and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel\n      an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they\n      cannot get married, and do not really want to.  Egwene is the love\n      object of both of Elayne&apos;s brothers, Galad and\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Gawyn</a>&#x2014;she is flattered by Galad&apos;s attentions, but\n      she does not return them.  She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a\n      dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene was\n      most likely chosen Amyrlin because the Aes Sedai thought she could be\n      guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they\n      made a grave mistake, for Egwene shows promise to be one of the\n      strongest Amyrlins in history.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Amyrlin\">Amyrlin Seat</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Mandragoran, Nynaeve ti al&apos;Meara</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elaida\">a&apos;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Elayne\">Trakand, Elayne</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Gawyn\">Trakand, Gawyn</a>.\n  "}]}
