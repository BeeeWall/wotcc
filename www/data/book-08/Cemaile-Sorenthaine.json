She was\n      raised from the Gray Ajah.  She was considered weak as Amyrlin.  In\n      memory of the days before the Trolloc Wars when no ruler held a throne\n      without the White Tower&apos;s approval, she had a gilded clock commissioned.\n      The clock was taken down and forgotten in storage after she died, and it\n      did not reappear until <a href=\"#Elaida\">Elaida</a> put it back up when\n      she was raised.
