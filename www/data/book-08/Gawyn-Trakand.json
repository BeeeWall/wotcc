{"id":"Gawyn-Trakand","name":"Gawyn Trakand","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 15:  Stronger than Written Law","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Gawyn\">Gawyn Trakand</a>,\n      p. 322 (360)&#x2014;Son of <a href=\"#Morgase\">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother\n      to <a href=\"#Elayne\">Elayne</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword\n      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother\n      Galad went to train with the Warders in the White\n      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now\n      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that\n      erupted after <a href=\"#Siuan\">Siuan Sanche</a>&apos;s deposition,\n      Gawyn formed a band of young men,\n      everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who\n      are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back against their\n      teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and <a href=\"#Leane\">Leane</a>\n      from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the\n      men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,\n      respectively, both of which were Blademasters&#x2014;few Warders are as\n      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  With recent\n      developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support&#x2014;he\n      believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and\n      Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts\n      surrounding the change in leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and\n      her friends <a href=\"#Nynaeve\">Nynaeve al&apos;Meara</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Egwene\">Egwene al&apos;Vere</a> side with those who broke from the\n      Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader.\n      He believes the rumor that <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand</a> killed his mother,\n      and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise\n      not to.  His sign is a white boar.\n  "}]}
