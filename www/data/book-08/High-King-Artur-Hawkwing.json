He was perhaps the most strongly <i>ta&apos;veren</i>\n      man besides <a href=\"#Lews\">Lews Therin Telamon</a> and\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>.  His armies put down those of\n      Guaire Amalasan, a false Dragon, and he even sent\n      troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son,\n      <a href=\"#Luthair\">Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin</a>, in hopes of conquering\n      new lands there.  All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing&apos;s\n      death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years.  The descendants of\n      the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of\n      Hawkwing&apos;s empire in the Old World&#x2014;they now call themselves the\n      Seanchan.  Artur Hawkwing&apos;s real name was Artur Paendrag Tanreall; his\n      sign was a golden hawk in flight.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Luthair\">Paendrag Mondwhin, Luthair</a>.\n  "}]}
