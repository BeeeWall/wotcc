{"id":"Jaichim-Carridin","name":"Jaichim Carridin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 28:  Crimsonthorn","info":"<a class=\"name\" name=\"Carridin\">Jaichim Carridin</a>,\n      p. 553 (630)&#x2014;Inquisitor for the Hand of the Light, better known as the\n      Questioners; he aspires to some day become High Inquisitor, perhaps even\n      Lord Captain Commander.  Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less\n      a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend.  He was given orders (under the\n      name Bors) by Ishamael to\n      find and kill <a href=\"#Rand\">Rand al&apos;Thor</a>, and those orders were\n      strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of\n      Carridin&apos;s family every month until al&apos;Thor was dead.  So far, Carridin\n      has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest\n      sister Dealda (carried from her bridal feast by a\n      Fade).  His older sister, Vanora, recently met\n      with a similar fate.  He himself was killed by\n      <a href=\"#Shiaine\">Shiaine</a> by drowning with brandy.\n\n\n  "}]}
