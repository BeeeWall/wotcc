She decided that her cause would\n      be better served by serving Luthair, so she created an <i>a&apos;dam</i>,\n      a silver leash with bracelet and collar that can be used to control\n      women who can channel.

Eventually Luthair and his\n      armies used Deain&apos;s own creation against her; when she herself was\n      collared, it was said that her screams shook the Towers of Midnight.\n  "}]}
