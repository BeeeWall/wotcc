Once this ability\n      manifested itself, his eyes took on the yellowish color of wolves&apos;\n      eyes.  He is bigger than most people, a fact which greatly helped him\n      as a blacksmith&apos;s apprentice, but the fact that he often underestimates\n      his strength has caused him to be very cautious.  He carries a large\n      battle ax at his belt.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Rand\">al&apos;Thor, Rand</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Mat\">Cauthon, Matrim</a>;\n      <a href=\"#Bull\">Young Bull</a>.\n  "}]}
