He was able to channel <i>saidin</i>,\n      and was gentled by the Red Ajah.  According to Thom, he stopped wanting\n      to live shorty afterward.  However, he was able to hold off the madness\n      for three years before that&#x2014;but he was beginning to show signs of\n      it when the Aes Sedai gentled him.  He used the One Power sparingly,\n      and then only to help his village, but the villagers were starting to\n      become fearful of him.  His death is still quite troubling to\n      Thom, and makes him suspicious of all Aes Sedai.\n      <i>See also</i>\n      <a href=\"#Thom\">Merrilin, Thomdril</a>.\n  "}]}
