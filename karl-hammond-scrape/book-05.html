<h3>Prologue:  The First Sparks Fall</h3>
<img src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" width="96" height="97" alt="Wheel of Time icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>,
      p. 13&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now
      raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She led the coup that
      deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>.
      Elaida was the advisor to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a>
      of Andor prior to her dismissal after
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>'s dissappearance.  She sometimes has the
      Foretelling; in fact, one of her first Foretellings concerned the
      importance of the Royal Family of Andor in the fight against the Shadow.
      She had this Foretelling during the time after
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a> disappeared and threw Andor into its
      third war of Succession&mdash;Elaida attached herself to Morgase as soon
      as it became apparent that she would be the one who would take the
      Throne.  However, since there was really no definite royal family at the
      time, the Foretelling could have concerned the previous royal family,
      that of <a href="#Mordrellen">Mordrellen</a>,
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>,
      and <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>.  Since two of these three have
      already had a major impact on the Pattern of the Age, it is likely that
      Elaida was not completely correct in her interpretation of her
      Foretelling.  Elaida is very strong in the One Power&mdash;only Siuan
      (before she was stilled),
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      Elayne, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few others are stronger.
      As a Red, Elaida is suspicious of all sisters of the Brown, Green,
      and Yellow Ajahs, and <i>hates</i> members of the Blue.  She does not
      believe she will be able to trust a Blue ever again.

  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 13&mdash;Leader of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.
      She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall
      of the Tower at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and
      weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their
      entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while
      there.  The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the
      Power and in her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be
      unanimous, as must the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is
      said to be &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;all previous
      affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs get
      fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two
      exceptions:  no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <a href="#Bonwhin">Bonwhin</a>, who was deposed and stilled for nearly
      breaking the Tower in <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day,
      except for <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last five Amyrlins (not counting
      Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to the mean
      number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction
      between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has a
      secretary of sorts, the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was
      raised from.  The office was held by <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with
      events surrounding the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her
      successor was the leader of the coup,
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>,
      raised from the Red Ajah.

      <a href="#Sierin">Vayu, Sierin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Danelle">Danelle</a>,
      p. 14 (13)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah, the only Brown sister among
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>'s group of followers and advisors that
      deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.  She is the typical Brown, often
      slight and seemingly lost in her own thoughts.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly of the Black.  Typical
      of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.  She serves
      as <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges against
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah
      would most likely have been divided over whether to depose Siuan, and
      only the Red would be behind Elaida.  This would most likely lead to the
      stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen
      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the
      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post
      was held by <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah until a
      coup deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and stilled both Siuan and
      Leane.  Her successor was <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of
      the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the
      Red.

  <li><a class="name" name="Teslyn">Teslyn Baradon</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Red Ajah with bony fingers.  She is a close second
      to <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> in severity.  One of four Reds among
      Elaida's advisors.
  <li><a class="name" name="Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;False Dragon
      who wreaked havoc in Saldaea before being captured by
      Aes Sedai.  He later escaped his captors, possibly with Black Ajah
      assistance.  It is believed that <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>
      may have dispatched his army to look for Taim.  Taim is very strong in
      the One Power, almost as strong as <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.

      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Tenobia">Queen Tenobia si Bashere Kazadi</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Queen of Saldaea, niece of
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, and cousin of
      <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>.  <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> thinks
      that the fact that her army is moving is a sign that she does not trust
      the Aes Sedai to deal with the escaped false Dragon
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>.

  <li><a class="name" name="Bashere">Davram t'Ghaline Bashere</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Lord of Bashere, Tyr, and Sidonia; Guardian of the
      Blightborder; Defender of the Heartland; Marshal-General to
      <a href="#Tenobia">Queen Tenobia</a> of Saldaea; and her uncle.  He is
      also <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>'s father.  He is one of the best
      military commanders in the World, in such company as
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, <a href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>,
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>, and
      <a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a>.

  <li><a class="name" name="Joline">Joline Maza</a>,
      p. 15 (14)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is fond of revealing, clinging dresses.
      She is the only Green among those who deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, who now advise <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Shemerin">Shemerin</a>,
      p. 15 (14)&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah, the only Yellow among those who deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and now advise
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>.  Slightly plump and fluttery, she never
      managed the outward calm displayed by most Aes Sedai.  She was the one
      who told <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> the Yellow Ajah signal.
      <!-- Elaida later ordered her reduced to Accepted, despite the fact that
      Tower law forbade her to do so. -->
  <li><a class="name" name="Javindhra">Javindhra Doraille</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She has smooth cheeks but a hard face and
      harsh voice.  She is a Sitter for the Red Ajah.
  <li><a class="name" name="Memara">Memara</a>,
      p. 16 (15)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> suggests her as an advisor
      to <a href="#Tenobia">Queen Tenobia</a> during the crisis with
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Niall">Lord Captain Commander Pedron Niall</a>,
      p. 16 (15)&mdash;Lord
      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, highest officer
      among the Children.  He is one of the great military commanders in the
      world, in company with <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      <a href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>, <a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a>,
      and <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>.  He is trying to
      get Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian so the Council of Nine
      will not invade both countries.  He is also trying to expand Amadicia's
      borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His headquarters is in Amadicia, and he
      rules there even above <a href="#Ailron">King Ailron</a>, although this
      is not spoken of openly.

      <a href="#Valda">Valda, Eamon</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Evanellein">Evanellein</a>,
      p. 16 (15)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is very concerned with her
      appearance, at least for a Gray.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</a>,
      p. 16 (15)&mdash;The Panarch of Tarabon.  She has vanished, allegedly at
      Aes Sedai hands, according to <a href="#Evanellein">Evanellein</a>.  In
      reality, Amathera was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah
      under <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a>, and was rescued by
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch's Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquo;), then she returned to her position.
  <li><a class="name" name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      p. 18 (16)&mdash;The
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir</a> to the Throne of Andor, daughter of
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a>, and
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>,
      sister of <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> and half-sister to
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>.  Now one of the Accepted.  Her sign is a
      golden lily.  She has blonde, curly hair.  She lived next door to
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> as a novice, and the two are very
      good friends.  She is currently travelling with fellow Accepted
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and two escorts sent to watch
      the two of them, <a href="#Thom">Thom Merrilin</a> and
      <a href="#Juilin">Juilin Sandar</a>.  Elayne is one of three women who
      is destined to fall in love with <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, according to a viewing that
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a> told her about.  The other two women are
      Min herself and <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>.  Elayne is not crazy
      about the notion of &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; Rand, but it would appear she
      does not have much choice.

  <li><a class="name" name="Andaya">Andaya Forae</a>,
      p. 18 (16)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  A thin, birdlike woman, she is outwardly timid
      despite Aes Sedai agelessness.  This makes her seem unlikely to be a
      good mediator, but she is in fact one of the best of them.

  <li><a class="name" name="Galad">Galadedrid (Galad)  Damodred</a>,
      p. 18 (16)&mdash;Son of <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s
      late husband <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a> and his first
      wife <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>.  He is half-brother to
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  Stunningly
      handsome, even <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> has trouble blushing when
      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai will often forsake their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with
      the sword, and has acheived Blademaster status in practice if not in
      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>'s deposition and joined
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is extremely
      virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it
      hurts, even himself.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point down.

  <li><a class="name" name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</a>,
      p. 18 (16)&mdash;By
      the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm,
      Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand.  She is the
      mother of <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.
      She married <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, a prince of
      Cairhien, Elayne and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.  She
      has since gone through several lovers, including
      <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard;
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>,
      a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril seems to be usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being
      Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously
      advised by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a> of the Red
      Ajah, who is now the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.

  <li><a class="name" name="DH">Daughter-Heir (of Andor)</a>,
      p. 18 (16)&mdash;By Andoran tradition, the oldest daughter of the Queen
      succeeds her on the Lion Throne.  No man is allowed to be King, at least
      not as more than a figurehead.  The previous Daughter-Heir,
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>, disappeared over twenty years
      ago; the current Daughter-Heir is <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>.
      It is also traditional for the Daughter-Heir and her oldest brother
      (who will become First Prince of the Sword when she becomes Queen) to
      train in Tar Valon, but Elayne is the first Daughter Heir, indeed, the
      first ruler of any kind in recent memory, to actually have enough
      ability to channel that she will become Aes Sedai.  The position of
      Daughter-Heir is somewhat in jeopardy at present:  Tar Valon has lost
      track of Elayne, the Queen of Andor has fled the country and is presumed
      dead by her citizens, and Elayne has no daughters to be her heirs if she
      does take the throne.

  <li><a class="name" name="Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>,
      p. 18 (17)&mdash;Advisor
      to Queen Morgase of Andor, and her latest love interest. She seems
      completely besotted with him, at least to the outside observer.  Gaebril
      arrived in Caemlyn just as riots sprang up throughout the city, and he
      joined and led one of the factions.  His faction restored order in the
      city, and upon Morgase's return from Tar Valon, he gave her her kingdom
      in one piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so happy that
      he had done this that she sent <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, her
      Aes Sedai advisor, away and made Gaebril her advisor.  However, during
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s trip through Caemlyn to deliver

  <li><a class="name" name="Gawyn">Gawyn Trakand</a>,
      p. 19 (17)&mdash;Son of
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother to
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which are Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  Gawyn did
      not know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who
      opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the
      same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> side with those
      who broke from the Tower.  This is especially difficult since Gawyn has
      feelings for Egwene, feelings which she returns.  However, he is afraid
      to speak up because Galad has similar feelings.
      His sign is a white boar.

      ago.  She was raised from the Red Ajah, the last Amyrlin besides

      influence to manipulate Hawkwing and make him a puppet ruler of the White
      Tower.  This ended in disaster, as Hawkwing laid seige to Tar Valon and
      attempted to destroy the Aes Sedai stronghold&mdash;he nearly succeeded.
      Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for nearly destroying
      the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has been raised.  She
      was succeeded by Deane Aryman of the Blue Ajah,
      who attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did to the Tower's reputation,
      and succeeded for the most part.  Unfortunately, this created extreme
      tension between the Red and Blue Ajahs that still exists today, and is
      the main reason why the Red Ajah will (and did) take any pretext to pull
      down an Amyrlin raised from the Blue Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 33 (27)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he lead the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</a>, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough for him to
      realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on
      <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where
      he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the
      present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of one
      of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews
      Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but without
      Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them.
      Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s head,
      offering advice or sobbing over lost women, but is getting more and
      more vocal.

      p. 40 (32)&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability
      that few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around
      people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  three different women are destined to fall in love with him,
      one of which is herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men;
      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  She worked in the Tower so <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>
      could have her and her viewings close by; she eventually helped Siuan

      considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be one
      of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  It is also thought
      that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she
      is currently in training with the Wise Ones to learn more of this
      Talent.  Egwene is good friends with

      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn.  In fact, Rand and
      Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels an
      almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot
      get married, and don't really want to.  Egwene is the love object of

      good friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attack on Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger
      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <i>ta'veren</i>
      qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such
      as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if
      the dice are weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form
      of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost
      every battle he fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16
      and 17, respectively.  His father Abell is one of
      the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.  In the
      Waste, he met a woman named <a href="#Melindhra">Melindhra</a>, a Maiden
      of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she is not the
      <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to
      marry according to the Aelfinn.  He has a scar along his neck from where
      the Eelfinn tried to kill him; this was also in accordance with
      what the Aelfinn told him, that he is
      &ldquo;to die and live again.&rdquo;

      the Accepted.  She has exceptional potential in the One Power, and will
      most likely be the most powerful Aes Sedai since the Age of Legends.
      However, Nynaeve's channeling is obstructed due to the fact that she had
      to learn to control her ability herself without really knowing what she
      was controlling; she is a wilder.  She can only touch the True Source
      when she is extremely angry.  She went, along with
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, to Tear

      for the time when <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> releases him from his
      bond so she can have him to herself.  She wants to become Aes Sedai for
      the sole purpose of Healing people; she thinks the Tower meddles in the
      affairs of others far too much, but she does need it to learn the skills
      necessary to help others.  She is determined to find a way to Heal
      everything short of death&mdash;she will not be convinced that anything
      short of that cannot be Healed, including stilling, gentling, and the
      wound on <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s side.

      Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and he can
      enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as

      always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found
      as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got
      out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      Master Luhhan on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He is currently in

      allied not only with the Nakai, but with the Reyn Aiel as well (who were
      not much better than blood enemies before the alliance was made).  He
      almost ended the blood feud between the Shaarad and Goshein clans (which

      Taardad, Nakai, Reyn, and Shaarad; across the Spine of the World to
      punish Laman for his Sin, throwing the entire World into war and
      allowing Prophecy to be fulfilled.

      and <a href="#Tenobia">Queen Tenobia</a>'s uncle (making Faile Tenobia's
      cousin).  She left home to become a Hunter when her father sent her
      younger brother off to fight while keeping her home; she finally decided
      she'd had enough of being at home and went to Illian.  While on her
      quest to hunt for the Horn, she encountered <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>,
      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>, and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> when they were
      persuing <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> to Tear.  She was shocked to find out
      that the Horn of Valere had already been <i>used</i>, much less found,
      and even more surprised that Rand was the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      When she found this information out, Moiraine forbade her to
      leave them, since if she did she could upset the balance of the world by
      telling the wrong person that the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a> was
      Reborn.  Faile eventually developed feelings for Perrin, feelings which
      he found he returned, and the two were married in Emond's Field shortly
      after the Trolloc threat was secured.

      <i><a href="#Aven">Avendesora</a></i>, the legendary Tree of Life, which
      was given as a gift to the people of Cairhien from the Aiel.  The
      Cairhienin never knew exactly why the Aiel gave them such a gift, and
      almost five hundred years later it was almost forgotten that it
      <i>was</i> a gift from them.  The tree, which grew in the center of the
      city of Cairhien, was cut down by
      <a href="#Laman">King Laman Damodred</a>
      twenty years ago, which precipitated the Aiel War.  Four
      clans of the Aiel crossed the Dragonwall under the leadership of
      <a href="#Janduin">Janduin</a>, <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s father and
      chief of the Taardad Aiel, to punish Laman for his sin.  The deep
      respect the Aiel held for the Cairhienin, as well as the passage
      through the Waste they were allowed, was terminated after Laman's
      Sin&mdash;the Aiel now refer to all Cairhienin as
      &ldquo;treekillers,&rdquo; and think nothing of killing or mistreating
      them.

      continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even
      Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed
      Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman's Pride, and his Sin, House
      Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never
      again reached any of its former glory&mdash;but it also allowed Prophecy
      to be fulfilled; the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was able to be

      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored
      into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore,
      allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the
      War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during
      which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their
      lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and
      were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War
      of the Shadow did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and
      re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison.  At the moment of sealing,
      Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and
      tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming
      all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.
      These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and
      the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.  Only
      three of them still hold, as far as is known, and despite being made of
      <i>cuendillar</i>, they would break by a fall from a table.

      her daughter to be extremely beautiful would name her Zarine.

  <li><a class="name" name="Aginor">Aginor</a>,
      p. 976 (692)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the second one to be released from the
      sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore,
      so he was not shielded from the passing of time very effectively; he
      emerged as a <em>very</em> old man, so old that his face was so wrinkled
      one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was killed by
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World.
  <li><a class="name" name="Balthamel">Balthamel</a>,
      p. 976 (692)&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  He was the first of the Forsaken to be
      released from the sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped very close to the
      surface of the Bore, and thus not shielded very effectively from the
      passage of time; he emerged so deformed by age that he had to hide his
      face behind a cloth and was unable to speak.  He was killed by the
      Green Man at the Eye of the World.
  <li><a class="name" name="Belal">Be'lal</a>,
      p. 976 (692)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was killed by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> in the
      Stone of Tear, just before <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Since he was destroyed by balefire, he is completely
      dead&mdash;not even the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> himself can bring
      him back.

      p. 976 (693)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Her whereabouts and activities are unknown.
  <li><a class="name" name="Coramoor">Coramoor</a>,
      p. 983 (697)&mdash;According to the Jendai Prophecy of the Atha'an Miere,
      the man who will take the Sea Folk from the sea.
      Since these prophecies are almost
      identical in most parts to the Prophecies of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, it is likely that <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>
      is the Coramoor as well.
