He is quite the ladies' man.  Thom is good at\n      juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks.  He also\n      carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in\n      various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread\n      from Thom to Mat, Min, and\n      Faile.  Thom was originally a bard in\n      Queen Morgase's Royal Court, and for a time after\n      her husband Taringail Damodred died, he was the\n      Queen's lover.  During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was\n      injured, and now walks with a limp because of it.  Thom is getting old,\n      such that he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and\n      other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied Elayne\n      and Nynaeve on their travels as per\n      Moiraine's request, despite the fact that he has\n      never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew, Owyn, was\n      gentled by the Red Ajah.  Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in\n      fact, his girlfried Dena was killed by Cairhienin soldiers because they\n      thought he was trying to play Daes Daemar against the Royal\n      House.  He has recently taken to traveling with Mat and his entourage,\n      ever since hooking up with him again in Ebou Dar.\n      See also\n      Trakand, Morgase.\n  "}]}
