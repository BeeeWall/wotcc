He cut the first's head\n      off, threw his sword at the second and speared him with it, and\n      took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it.  He is\n      wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot.  He\n      is fond of teasing women.  He claims to have been a merchant's guard,\n      then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn.  He is now a lieutenant in\n      the Queen's Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him the captain of her\n      bodyguard.  He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or\n      handsome.  He moves with a swordsman's grace, and is very strong.\n      Mellar claims to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claims to have\n      fought on Morgase's side during the Succession.\n      Half the palace has accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne's\n      twins, though he himself may be unaware that this rumor exists.\n      Unbeknownst to Elayne or practically anyone else, he also answers to the\n      name Daved Hanlon, a Darkfriend.  To him, a name\n      is akin to a coat—to be changed regularly and to suit the\n      conditions.\n      See also\n      Hanlon, Daved.\n  "}]}
