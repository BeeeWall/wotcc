{"id":"Queen-Mordrellen-Mantear","name":"Queen Mordrellen Mantear","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 11:  Talk of Debts","info":"Queen Mordrellen Mantear,\n      p. 290 (343)—By\n      the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the\n      Realm, etc. before Morgase.  Her death and the\n      previous disappearance of her daughter Tigraine\n      set off the Succession, called the Third War of Andoran Succession by\n      those not from Andor.  Her advisor was\n      Gitara Moroso\n      of the Blue Ajah.  She is, unknown to everyone except\n      Rand himself, Rand's grandmother.  Editor's note:\n      her name is actually listed as Queen Modrellein by Dyelin in other\n      books. I have little idea which one is actually correct, so I just\n      picked this spelling.  There is also a reference made to the character\n      of Modrellein as the hero of Andor who rode into the middle of the\n      battle 700 years ago, reversed the retreat, rallied the army, and won\n      the battle—I think this is probably who she was confused\n      with.\n      See also\n      al'Thor, Rand;\n      Damodred, Galadedrid;\n      Damodred, Tigraine.\n  "}]}
