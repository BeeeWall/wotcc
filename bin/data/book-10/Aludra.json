{"id":"Aludra","name":"Aludra","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 2:  Two Captains","info":"Aludra,\n      p. 120 (131)â€”Illuminator from\n      Tarabon with dark waist-length hair done in thin braids, large dark\n      eyes, and a plump mouth.  She was involved with the fireworks display\n      for King Galldrian of Cairhien that went awry\n      when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, though she\n      believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame.\n      She was cast out of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to\n      stop practicing the art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill\n      her.  She was saved by Mat and Thom in a barn,\n      and as a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.\n      She later came to Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.\n      He was knocked out during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder,\n      but Aludra escaped and she now travels with Mat's entourage.\n      Note:  it is widely speculated that Aludra is looking for a\n      bellfounder for a specific reason:  she wants to build a cannon.\n      See also\n      Cauthon, Matrim.\n  "}]}
