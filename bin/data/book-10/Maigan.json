{"id":"Maigan","name":"Maigan","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 30:  What the Oath Rod Can Do","info":"Maigan,\n      p. 662 (801)—Long-faced,\n      beautiful, large-eyed full-lipped Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  She\n      seems elongated somehow, though not tall.  She was the Blue Ajah's\n      replacement for Anaiya on\n      Egwene's “Council” of sisters.  She\n      was one of Siuan's allies when she was\n      Amyrlin, but now she blames Siuan for breaking\n      the Tower.  She stands as high as Myrelle or\n      Morvrin in the Power.  Siuan was forced to beg\n      for readmittance into the Blue Ajah, and Maigan was one of the ones who\n      most insisted on the begging.  She is Lelaine's to her\n      toenails.\n  "}]}
