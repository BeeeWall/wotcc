{"id":"Birgitte","name":"Birgitte","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 10:  A Blazing Beacon","info":"Birgitte,\n      p. 271–272 (320)—Hero of Legend, bound to the Horn of Valere until\n      Moghedien ripped her away.  She has long blonde\n      hair that she keeps in a braid, and is one of the best with bow and\n      arrows in all human history.  During Nynaeve's\n      struggle with Moghedien, Birgitte was ripped out of\n      Tel'aran'rhiod and almost died.  She would have if she had not\n      been saved by Elayne, who bonded her as a Warder\n      to give her the strength and quick healing she needed to survive.  She\n      is always linked to Gaidal Cain in the stories,\n      and misses him immensely since he was spun out normally while she was\n      ripped out.  She is nothing like the stories say she is supposed to be\n      like, except that she is pretty.  She is slowly losing her\n      memories of past lives, and worries she will eventually forget\n      everything—she currently remembers nothing before the founding of\n      the White Tower.\n      See also\n      Cain, Gaidal;\n      Trahelion, Birgitte;\n      Trakand, Elayne.\n  "}]}
