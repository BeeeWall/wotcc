She is a dark-eyed young woman, though barely\n      more than a girl.  She pledged the support of her House to\n      Elayne.  She is very presumptuous and snooty,\n      especially for someone who had not even heard of\n      Gareth Bryne (Elayne claims that miners in Baerlon\n      had heard Lord Bryne's name).  Her sign is a blue bear.\n  "}]}
