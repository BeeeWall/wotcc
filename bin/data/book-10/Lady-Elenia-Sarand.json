She still\n      plans to take it from Elayne, though once she was\n      rescued from Aringill by Arymilla's men, her\n      claim vanished.  Her House now supports Arymilla for the Lion\n      Throne and the Rose Crown of Andor.  However, she thinks Arymilla\n      “lacks the wit” to be queen, and Elayne too\n      immature—she is also not above causing “accidents”\n      for her rivals.\n      See also\n      Arawn, Naean;\n      Marne, Arymilla.\n  "}]}
