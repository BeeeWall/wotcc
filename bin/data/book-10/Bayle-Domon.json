His ship was captured by\n      Egeanin at Falme, and she was afraid Domon would\n      recognize her the next time they met.  She was right—he did.\n      He is now one of Egeanin's so'jhin.  When Egeanin captured his\n      ship, he was trying to drop the male a'dam in the ocean.\n      The two are now involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could\n      stay together), which no one else seems to understand—anyone who\n      talks to either of them seems to find them impossible to get along\n      with.\n      See also\n      Tamarath, Egeanin.\n  "}]}
