She was the daughter of a Lugard furniture\n      maker, and is a bit above average height.  When the Hall was arguing\n      over who to raise as Amyrlin years back, it was\n      deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty\n      years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or\n      more years than were common.  Seaine suggested\n      Siuan Sanche,\n      then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for only\n      ten years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by\n      Elaida to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida\n      hopes to expose Alviarin on the suspicion that\n      she is Black Ajah.  She and her friend since novicehood,\n      Pevara, have successfully captured and bound with\n      the Oath Rod a member of the Black Ajah, and are hot on the trail to\n      finding more.\n      See also\n      Tazanovni, Pevara.\n  "}]}
