She tried to\n      Heal Rand's side wound and failed, but when\n      Damer Flinn was able to Heal him using a more\n      sophisticated weave, she begged on her knees for him to teach her.\n      She is slender, has hazel eyes, and dark hair that she keeps bells in.\n      She grew up in Arafel.\n      See also\n      Flinn, Damer;\n      Roshan.\n  "}]}
