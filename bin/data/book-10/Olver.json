{"id":"Olver","name":"Olver","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 2:  Two Captains","info":"Olver,\n      p. 118 (129)—Boy of nine who sat on\n      the wrong horse and almost had his neck broken for the trouble.  He was\n      adopted after a fashion by Mat and his Band of the\n      Red Hand.  His parents were killed when the Shaido ravaged Cairhien.  He\n      is short, pale, and quite ugly.  He likes to chase women.  He is a good\n      horse racer, and travels with Mat and Luca's show.\n      He has a certain fascination with the game Snakes and Foxes, and does\n      not seem to understand that there is no way to win without cheating.\n      Note:  many people think that Olver may be the Rebirth of\n      Gaidal Cain—he is certainly ugly, as Gaidal\n      was, and with Min's viewing of\n      Birgitte's adventures with an ugly man both far\n      older than her and far younger than her, it seems to fit.  Also, there\n      is speculation that Olver's obsession with Snakes and Foxes, which is\n      based on dealings with the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, will allow him (or Mat,\n      Thom, or someone else who would observe his\n      solutions) to puzzle out how to beat the Eelfinn and get\n      Moiraine back from them.\n      See also\n      Adria;\n      Jameine.\n  "}]}
