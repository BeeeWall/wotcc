She led the group of six sisters that held most of\n      the influence in Salidar, despite not being part of the Hall of the\n      Tower.  Her tilted, green eyes can be used to intimidate novices and Aes\n      Sedai alike.  She is now the\n      Keeper of the Chronicles\n      under Egwene al'Vere.  She is very\n      efficient, but she hates the paperwork involved with being Keeper, and\n      is often heard muttering under her breath that she wishes she were still\n      Mistress of Novices.\n      See also\n      Arinvar;\n      Keeper of the Chronicles;\n      Mistress of Novices.\n  "}]}
