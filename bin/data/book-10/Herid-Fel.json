He was torn limb\n      from limb by a gholam for unknown reasons, although it is likely\n      that he had stumbled upon something quite damaging to the cause of the\n      Shadow if they would send a gholam to do the job.\n      Min is currently reading his book, Reason and\n      Unreason, in an attempt to better understand why he was murdered.\n      Rand cannot make up from down in Fel's books, but Min finds them\n      fascinating.\n      See also\n      Farshaw, Elmindreda.\n  "}]}
