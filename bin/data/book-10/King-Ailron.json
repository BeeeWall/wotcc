{"id":"King-Ailron","name":"King Ailron","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Glimmers of the Pattern","info":"King Ailron,\n      p. 28 (17)—King of Amadicia until\n      the Seanchan invaded.  He was not as strong as most kings due to the\n      control of the Children of the Light—in fact, he had almost no\n      real power at all.  During the invasion, he took his army to engage the\n      invaders near Jeramel; they were slaughtered, and Ailron himself was\n      captured in what Valda now calls “Ailron's\n      Disaster.”\n      See also\n      Niall, Pedron;\n      Valda, Eamon.\n  "}]}
