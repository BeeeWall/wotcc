He was a Warder at one time, bonded\n      to an Aes Sedai named Rina, and left the Tower when\n      he discoverd that he could talk to wolves.  He did not find any problem\n      with the ability by itself, but felt the need to get away from the Red\n      Ajah, who thought they should gentle him (even though there was nothing\n      to be gentled) because of his ability.  Elyas helped\n      Perrin learn that he could talk to wolves as well;\n      Perrin does not necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over the\n      dislike of it as well.  The wolves call him\n      Long Tooth.  Compared to him, Aiel are noisy\n      when they are not trying to be heard.\n      See also\n      Aybara, Perrin t'Bashere;\n      Hafden, Rina;\n      Long Tooth.\n  "}]}
