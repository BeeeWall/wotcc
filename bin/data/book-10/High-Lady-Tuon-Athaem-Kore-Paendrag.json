She has brown eyes and no hair (it has been shaved off).  She\n      is also called the Daughter of the Nine Moons, the\n      woman Mat was told he will marry.  Mat has since\n      kidnapped her (in a matter of speaking), and she travels with him under\n      strictest secrecy.  She is very small—short and slender.  She is,\n      however, 20 years old, about the same age as Mat.  She has very long\n      eyelashes.\n      See also\n      Cauthon, Matrim;\n      Daughter of the Nine Moons;\n      Dorje, Anath;\n      Empress (of Seanchan), The;\n      Selucia.\n  "}]}
