Aran'gar was the right-hand dagger\n      in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore.  The\n      sport fell from common practice, since almost invariably both duelists\n      died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The other Forsaken consider\n      Balthamel's new body a fine joke; the soul of Balthamel now occupies the\n      body of a beautiful young woman.  She still channels saidin, and\n      now serves as Delana's maid.  Delana does not know\n      that she is one of the Chosen reincarned, just that she stands far above\n      her among the Darkfriends.\n      See also\n      Mosalaine, Delana;\n      Osan'gar;\n      Saranov, Halima.\n  "}]}
