She vanished, allegedly at\n      Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies.  In reality, Amathera\n      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under\n      Liandrin, and was rescued by\n      Elayne and Nynaeve.  They\n      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the\n      mob outside the Panarch's Palace (since it is not all that far from\n      “The Panarch is dead!” to “Death to the\n      Panarch!”), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan\n      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new\n      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.  She\n      served as a dancer for High Lady Suroth, the\n      leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces, until she was rescued by\n      Juilin Sandar, who took her along when he fled\n      Ebou Dar with Mat.\n      See also\n      Sandar, Juilin.\n  "}]}
