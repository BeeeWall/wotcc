She led Rand's honor guard until\n      she accidentally spoke to gai'shain as if they were still Maidens\n      of the Spear.  To attempt to equal their shame, she became a servant in\n      the palace, dressed in the same clothing they wore and attempted to\n      behave in their manner.  She ended her tenure as a servant when she\n      learned that Rand had been captured, and led the rescue party of Maidens\n      to Dumai's Wells.  She then went with Perrin to\n      find Masema, and led the team of Maidens to search\n      for Faile when she was captured.\n  "}]}
