{"id":"Cyndane","name":"Cyndane","chapters":[{"title":"Epilogue:  An AnswerGlossary","info":"Cyndane,\n      p. 690 (834)—Girl who works\n      with Moghedien.  Her name means “Last\n      Chance” in the Old Tongue.  She is stronger in the One Power than\n      Graendal, but not as strong as\n      Lanfear used to be.  She is actually Lanfear\n      reincarnated.  Note:  It is my speculation that Lanfear was somehow\n      weakened in the One Power after leaving the land of the Eelfinn.  When\n      Mat went there, his last wish was to get out of\n      there; if hers was not, she may have died there, and they took both her\n      life and some of her strength from her as a price.\n  "}]}
