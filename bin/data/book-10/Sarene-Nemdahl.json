She has a temper, but she will admit she is wrong if\n      she is.  She taught novice classes on “the nature of\n      reality.” Her Warder is Vitalien.\n      She has a secret love of writing poetry—she would die of shame if\n      Vitalien ever discovered that she compares him to a leopard and other\n      graceful, powerful animals in her poems.\n      She assisted in Rand's kidnapping,\n      was captured and shielded after the battle at Dumai's Wells, and is now\n      a prisoner of the Aiel, sworn to Rand.  According to\n      Min's viewing, she will fall in love.  She is so\n      beautiful that she makes Erian look plain.\n      See also\n      Vitalien.\n  "}]}
