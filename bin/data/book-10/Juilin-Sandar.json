He accompanied\n      Nynaeve and Elayne on their\n      travels because Lan asked him to.  He accepted partly\n      out of respect for Lan, and partly out of guilt; he betrayed Elayne,\n      Egwene, and Nynaeve to the Black Ajah when\n      Liandrin used Compulsion on him, and later\n      realized how wrong it was.  He carries a notched sword-breaker and a\n      staff with which he is deadly.  He has fallen in love with\n      Amathera, the Panarch of Tarabon.\n      See also\n      Lounault, Amathera Aelfdene Casmir.\n  "}]}
