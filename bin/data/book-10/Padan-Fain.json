{"id":"Padan-Fain","name":"Padan Fain","chapters":[{"title":"Epilogue:  An AnswerGlossary","info":"Padan Fain,\n      p. 689 (832)—Former peddler that frequently came to Emond's Field.  A\n      Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the\n      Dragon Reborn\n      and narrowed it to three boys in Emond's Field.\n      While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of\n      Mordeth in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.\n      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls\n      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain\n      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.\n      It is said, “The look of the Eyeless is fear,” from\n      observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.\n      Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal—Fades feel the same fear\n      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called\n      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak\n      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He now served for a\n      time as advisor to Toram Riatin, one of the\n      Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to Rand.  Rand has a bounty\n      of 100,000 gold crowns on his head—Fain killed Rand's friends\n      because they were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because\n      it was his homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it.  In\n      addition, Moridin is now hunting Fain, although\n      indirectly—he sent Isam (alias\n      Slayer) to kill him.\n  "}]}
