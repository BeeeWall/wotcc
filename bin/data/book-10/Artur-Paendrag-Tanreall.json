All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing's\n      death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years.  The descendants of\n      the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of\n      Hawkwing's empire in the Old World—they now call themselves the\n      Seanchan.  His sign was a golden hawk in flight.\n      See also\n      Hawkwing, Artur;\n      Paendrag Mondwhin, Luthair.\n  "}]}
