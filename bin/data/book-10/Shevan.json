She is bonily thin and taller than most men.  She\n      has an angular face, long chin, spidery fingers, and curly hair.  She\n      was a very recent addition to the Hall, though unlike many of the other\n      sisters raised in recent weeks, she was actually a logical choice to\n      succeed—Saerin had mentioned that Shevan would\n      likely have been her replacement when she decided to step down.\n  "}]}
