Rand put her in charge of Cairhien along\n      with Rhuarc until she left with\n      Perrin and Faile to find\n      Masema.  She is fond of wearing the latest fashion\n      in dresses, and those are usually quite revealing.  She has her eyes on\n      many men, but Perrin foremost—she is\n      Min's hawk in her viewings of Perrin.  She has black\n      hair.  She is a very capable ruler, willing to do almost anything to\n      preserve the welfare and independence of her people.  She is tall,\n      pretty, young, and has black hair.\n      See also\n      t'Aybara, Faile ni Bashere;\n      Aybara, Perrin t'Bashere;\n      Gallenne, Bertain;\n      Larisen, Annoura.\n  "}]}
