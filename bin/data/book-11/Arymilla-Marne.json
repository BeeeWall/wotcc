She\n      opposed Morgase during the Succession.  The only\n      real reason Rand kept her around in Caemlyn was to\n      push others into supporting Dyelin; no one wanted\n      Andor in the hands of Arymilla.  Once Elayne\n      returned to Andor, she exiled Arymilla as her mother had.  However,\n      Arymilla learned of where Naean and\n      Elenia were being detained in Murandy and rescued\n      them.  This debt of sorts bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support\n      Arymilla's claim to the Lion Throne.  She now has the support of five\n      major houses of Andor.  She is plump, verging on stout, has a vacuous\n      smile, and brown eyes that are almost always wide with interest.  Her\n      sign is four silver moons on a twilight blue field.\n      See also\n      Arawn, Naean;\n      Sarand, Elenia.\n  "}]}
