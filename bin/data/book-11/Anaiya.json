She was very good\n      friends with Moiraine both as a novice and as a\n      full sister.  She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when\n      Elaida was raised to the Striped Stole, and\n      carried a position of considerable influence in the “Little\n      Tower” in exile from Tar Valon.  She dressed very simply, and very\n      little upset her.  She was Aes Sedai for 50 or 60 years before\n      Kairen came to the Tower.  She was killed, along\n      with her Warder, presumably by Aran'gar.\n  "}]}
