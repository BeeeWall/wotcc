Originally a sul'dam, she\n      was intended to be the Leash Holder for Nynaeve\n      when she and Egwene were given to Suroth by\n      Liandrin.  She was later promoted to a Voice of\n      the Blood, the first sul'dam to ascend to the Blood.  It\n      was thought unwise to leave her as a simple sul'dam; she found\n      Renna and Seta, collared and\n      helpless, and brought them to Suroth.  Suroth hid them for the good of\n      the Empire, and promoted Alwhin to a Voice of the Blood.  Alwhin was\n      killed by Liandrin by poison, which caused her eyes to bulge and her\n      face to turn blue before the end.  Liandrin killed her because she\n      thought she could curry favor with Suroth by doing so.  Suroth was not\n      pleased.\n      See also\n      Liandrin;\n      Meldarath, Suroth Sabelle.\n  "}]}
