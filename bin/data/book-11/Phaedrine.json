She instructed\n      Egwene when Egwene was a novice in the White\n      Tower; she still seems surprised that Egwene is now the\n      Amyrlin.  She is lean as a heron, small-boned,\n      and has dark hair and brown eyes.  She is usually unkempt.  She is good\n      friends with Ashmanaille.\n  "}]}
