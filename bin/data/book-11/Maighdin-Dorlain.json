She did not reveal her true\n      identity, Morgase Trakand of Andor—she uses\n      her mother's first name as a disguise.  She became one of\n      Faile's servants, much to her own dismay (being\n      used to commanding the servants, not being one), and was\n      eventually captured by the Shaido and made gai'shain.  She is\n      beginning to adapt to her new status, though she has lost none of the\n      toughness that made her such an effective ruler.\n      See also\n      Trakand, Morgase.\n  "}]}
