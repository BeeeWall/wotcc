She has many wise sayings, which Elayne and Morgase are fond\n      of quoting to themselves and others (probably because they have been\n      ingrained into their minds so much).  She went with Morgase when she\n      fled Andor to Amadicia, and now serves as Faile's\n      chief maid.  She is bony, and has white hair.  In Faile's absence, she\n      works with Perrin to get her back.\n  "}]}
