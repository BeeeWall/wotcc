Born of a butcher,\n      she is extremely flamboyant and has no fewer than three clocks\n      in her rooms.   She has an extreme dislike of men.  Tsutama resigned as\n      a Sitter fifteen years ago and went into “voluntary”\n      retreat after participating in the “disgusting events” of\n      twenty years ago.  When she returned, she was perceived as nervous and\n      shifty, but now that she has been raised to the head of the Red Ajah\n      (their Highest), that perception has been revealed to be incorrect.\n  "}]}
