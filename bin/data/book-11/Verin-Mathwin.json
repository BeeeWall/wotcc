{"id":"Verin-Mathwin","name":"Verin Mathwin","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 18:  News for the Dragon","info":"Verin Mathwin,\n      p. 386—Aes Sedai\n      of the Brown Ajah who accompanied Egwene,\n      Elayne, and Nynaeve back\n      from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder is named\n      Tomas.  She is more interested in current events\n      than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened\n      now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted stone\n      ring ter'angreal to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told\n      Morgase that there was really no need to keep her\n      in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a\n      novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway.  When\n      Verin went to the Two Rivers with Alanna, they\n      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they\n      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including\n      Mat's sister Bode.  When she and\n      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and\n      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is\n      quite old—her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai\n      means she is quite old indeed.  She is now with\n      Cadsuane's group of sisters in Tear.\n      See also\n      Tomas.\n  "}]}
