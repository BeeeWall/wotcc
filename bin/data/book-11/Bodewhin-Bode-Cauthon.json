She\n      came with Verin and Alanna to\n      become Aes Sedai.  She has the spark inborn; she will channel whether\n      she wants to or not.  She is now a novice in the rebel Tower under\n      Egwene.  She is strong in Earth, and Egwene has\n      her making objects out of cuendillar.  She is plump-cheeked and\n      pretty.  She wears her hair in a dark braid, though Egwene suspects she\n      did not have the Women's Circle's permission to do so—it does not\n      matter anymore, however, as she is not in Emond's Field anymore.\n      See also\n      Cauthon, Matrim.\n  "}]}
