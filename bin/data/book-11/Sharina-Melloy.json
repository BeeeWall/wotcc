{"id":"Sharina-Melloy","name":"Sharina Melloy","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 23:  Call to a Sitting","info":"Sharina Melloy,\n      p. 480—Grandmother recruited as a novice along the way from Salidar\n      to Tar Valon.  She has more potential than\n      Nynaeve.  She is dignified, and has gray hair\n      that she keeps in a tight bun at the back of her head.  She ran a very\n      large family with a very firm hand until her children (and their\n      children) grew up.  She seems to have adopted all of the novices as\n      granddaughters, or at least as great nieces.  She was the woman who\n      organized all the novices into “families”—she was\n      apparently disgusted watching everyone simply floundering around.\n      Editor's note:  there is a distinct possibility that this Sharina is\n      the same one as the Aes Sedai advisor to Nynaeve and\n      Lan from Nynaeve's test for being raised to Accepted.\n      These tests may be based on possible future events, and the chance that\n      Sharina became the advisor to the King of Malkier in one possible\n      timeline is pretty good.\n  "}]}
