She has green eyes, and an\n      unusually small nose for a Saldaean.  She is friends with\n      Atuan, which makes those who know about Atuan\n      suspicious that Pritalle may also be Black.  She was among those who\n      captured Egwene.  Pritalle did her best to avoid\n      teaching classes, and made little effort to disguise her loathing of\n      it when forced to teach.\n      See also\n      Harril;\n      Larisett, Atuan.\n  "}]}
