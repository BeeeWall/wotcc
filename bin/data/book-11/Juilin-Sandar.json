He accompanied\n      Nynaeve and Elayne on their\n      travels because Lan asked him to.  He accepted partly\n      out of respect for Lan, and partly out of guilt; he betrayed Elayne,\n      Egwene, and Nynaeve to the Black Ajah when\n      Liandrin used Compulsion on him, and later\n      realized how wrong it was.  He carries a notched sword-breaker and a\n      staff with which he is deadly.  He has fallen in love with\n      Amathera, the Panarch of Tarabon.  He travels\n      with Mat Cauthon now.\n      See also\n      Lounault, Amathera Aelfdene Casmir.\n  "}]}
