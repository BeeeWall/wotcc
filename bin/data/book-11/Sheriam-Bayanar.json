She was\n      Mistress of Novices in the White Tower before she\n      fled to Salidar with the rest of her Ajah.  She led the group of six\n      sisters that held most of the influence in Salidar, despite not being\n      part of the Hall of the Tower.  Her tilted, green eyes can be used to\n      intimidate novices and Aes Sedai alike.  She is now the\n      Keeper of the Chronicles under\n      Egwene al'Vere.  She is very efficient, but she\n      hates the paperwork involved with being Keeper, and is often heard\n      muttering under her breath that she wishes she were still Mistress of\n      Novices.\n      See also\n      Arinvar;\n      Keeper of the Chronicles;\n      Mistress of Novices.\nChapter 1:  When Last Sounds\n\n  "}]}
