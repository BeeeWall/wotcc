{"id":"Alanna-Mosvani","name":"Alanna Mosvani","chapters":[{"title":"Chapter 21:  Within the Stone","info":"Alanna Mosvani,\n      p. 445â€”Aes Sedai\n      of the Green Ajah.  She is dark and slender with black hair and dark\n      eyes.  She has two surviving Warders, Rand (whom she\n      bonded against his will) and Ihvon; her other,\n      Owein, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the\n      Whitecloak camp.  She later found that bonding Rand was a grievious\n      error; not only is it impossible to Compel him in comparison to most\n      Warders (she compared it to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her\n      bare hands), but she constantly feels the pain he experiences from the\n      wound in his side, perhaps even more severely than he feels it.  She is\n      now in Tear, but the other Aes Sedai there are avoiding her notice.\n      See also\n      al'Thor, Rand.\n  "}]}
