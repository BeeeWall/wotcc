She has black eyes, and is quite pretty.  She sat\n      on the Knitting Circle.  She is very strong in the One Power, and\n      because of this was chosen to hold Ispan Shefar's\n      shield during her captivity.  She held a small weaver's shop in Ebou\n      Dar until the city was overrun by the Seanchan.  She looks about 70, but\n      she actually ran away from the White Tower about three hundred years\n      ago.  Because she was a runaway, she is now being made to wear novice\n      white and is being instructed by Vandene.\n  "}]}
