{"id":"Logain-Ablar","name":"Logain Ablar","chapters":[{"title":"Prologue:  Embers Falling on Dry Grass","info":"Logain Ablar,\n      p. 52—False\n      Dragon who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding\n      nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah.  He got loose\n      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of\n      Siuan Sanche,\n      and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and\n      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled he was of considerable\n      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.\n      Min still has viewings of him with a halo over his\n      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great\n      power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain later came forward with\n      information that indicated that the Red Ajah actually put him up to\n      declaring himself the Dragon Reborn, most likely\n      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more\n      glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.  Logain was recently\n      Healed by Nynaeve, and was let free by\n      Egwene to do as he pleased.  He chose to go to\n      the Black Tower, and now leads a part of the Asha'man that seem to be\n      discontent with Taim's leadership.  When Aes Sedai\n      came to the Black Tower to attempted to capture the Asha'man (not\n      realizing their numbers), Logain bonded two sisters to him as\n      “wives” using the “wife bond” that the Asha'man\n      developed, Toveine Gazal of the Red Ajah and\n      Gabrelle of the Brown Ajah.  He has curly black\n      hair and broad shoulders.  Logain was actually a minor Ghealdanin noble\n      before his titles were stripped away when he declared himself the\n      Dragon Reborn.\n      See also\n      Dragon, The;\n      Dragon Reborn;\n      Gabrelle;\n      Gazal, Toveine;\n      Taim, Mazrim.\n  "}]}
