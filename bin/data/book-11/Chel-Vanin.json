He is a good rider, and Mat\n      thinks he could steal a hen pheasant's eggs with her sitting on them\n      (although he would likely steal her, too)—he also thinks Vanin\n      could steal a horse out from under a nobleman and he would not know it\n      for two days.  He has a large space between his front teeth.  He went\n      with Mat to Ebou Dar, and escaped the city with Mat to travel with\n      Valan Luca's show.\n  "}]}
