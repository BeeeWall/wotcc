He is a modern hero, a\n      traveler and writer.

It is thought that he was a victim of\n      Ba'alzamon's scheming, and he escaped to the Ogier\n      stedding and was never heard from again.  He is quite likely\n      posing as Noal Charin, a member of the party\n      traveling with Mat Cauthon, though Noal claims Jain\n      was his cousin.\n      See also\n      Charin, Jain;\n      Charin, Noal;\n      Farstrider, Jain.\n  "}]}
