He is now\n      one of the Asha'man.  He is loyal to Rand, not\n      Taim.  After being placed on the Traitor's List, he\n      went in to hiding—he did not assist in the attack on Rand, but\n      Rand thought it better to be safe than have him killed.  He has since\n      been bonded as a Warder by Merise.  He wielded\n      Callandor at the cleansing of saidin, though the circle\n      was controlled by one of the women.  Merise took away his dragon pin at\n      first, claiming it was not appropriate for him to wear it in lieu of his\n      new responsibilites as her Warder—Jahar was very angry with her\n      for this, and she will eventually have to learn that he is much stronger\n      than she is, and she needs to give him respect appropriate to that\n      position.\n      See also\n      Haindehl, Merise.\n  "}]}
