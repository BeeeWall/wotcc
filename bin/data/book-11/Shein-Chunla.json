The Hall mishandled events itself, too, leading to one of\n      only six mutinies in Tower history, which pulled down both Shein and\n      the Hall.  She allegedly died of natural causes, but in fact she was\n      smothered in her bed in exile fifty-one years later after a plot was\n      discovered to put her back on the Amyrlin Seat.\n      See also\n      Garen.\n  "}]}
