During the War of the Shadow, he was one of the Shadow's\n      greatest military commanders.  His name means “Destroyer of\n      Hope” in the Old Tongue.  After being released from the Bore, he\n      took up residence on the Council of Nine in Illian as\n      Lord Brend, and effectively ruled the country.  He\n      wore a battle scar that he got while fighting\n      Lews Therin Telamon\n      during the War of the Shadow.  He could have had it\n      Healed, but kept it to remind himself of what Lews Therin had done to\n      him.  He is believed dead at the hands of Mashadar.\n  "}]}
