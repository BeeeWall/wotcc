She is\n      dark and slender, and has strength in the Power; she is on the same\n      level as Sheriam.  She tries to seem tall even\n      though she is not.  She grew up in Arafel, and she seems to put great\n      store in ceremony.  She is far too young to be a Sitter, at least\n      normally.  She has a sharp nose.\n  "}]}
