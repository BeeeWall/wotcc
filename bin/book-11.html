  <li><a class="name" name="Comadrin">Madoc Comadrin</a>,
      p. 9&mdash;General,
      long dead, and author of <i>Fog and Steel</i>.
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> remembers reading his book in a past life; he
      doubts a copy exists today.  He met him once, about six hundred years
      before <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a> was born, after Mat lost a
      battle to him.
<h3>Prologue:  Embers Falling on Dry Grass</h3>
<img src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" width="96" height="97" alt="Wheel of Time icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Galad">Galadedrid (Galad)  Damodred</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Son of <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s late husband
      Taringail Damodred and his first
      wife <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>.  He is half-brother to
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  Stunningly
      handsome, even <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> has trouble blushing when
      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai will often forsake their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with
      the sword, and has achieved Blademaster status in practice if not in
      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>'s deposition and joined
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is
      extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless
      of who it hurts, even himself.  In fact, he started a war in Samara to
      help Elayne and Nynaeve escape.  His sign is a winged silver sword,
      point down.  Galad has feelings for
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>, and
      although she is flattered by his attentions, she does not return his
      love.  He is quite popular among his soldiers.  Galad believes
      that <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a> killed his mother
      after sexually abusing her, and vows revenge.  He is incorrect about
      the killing part, at least.
<!-- Perhaps unsurprisingly, Galad appears to be showing signs that he
<i>might</i> be able to learn to channel.  Since his half-sister (Elayne) can,
and his half-brother (Rand) can, it seems likely that Galad inherited some
channeling ability as well.  Page 23-->

  <li><a class="name" name="Valda">Lord Captain Commander Eamon Valda</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Lord
      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light after the death of
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>.  He killed Niall's assassin shortly
      after the act, but it is not known whether this was set up, or whether
      Valda just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  One of
      his first acts was to dismiss Niall's secretary,
      <a href="#Balwer">Sebban Balwer</a>, for &ldquo;someone who didn't
      twitch.&rdquo;  This was a mistake, as Balwer was Niall's
      <i>true</i> Master of Spies&mdash;he knows more about spying than
      anyone else in the world.  Valda offered assistance to
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>, as Niall had promised, but before doing
      so he required a &ldquo;service&rdquo; of her:  to share his bed.
      Morgase escaped during the Seanchan attack, and Valda believes her to be
      dead.  He has since fallen into disfavor with the Children of the Light,
      most especially with <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, because of his dealings
      with Morgase; Galad because she is his stepmother, and with the other
      Children because she trained with the &ldquo;witches&rdquo; in Tar
      Valon.

  <li><a class="name" name="Trom">Captain Trom</a>,
      p. 16&mdash;Stocky
      Whitecloak who allegedly uncovered the &ldquo;Darkfriends&rdquo; that
      were hanged in <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s presence.  He has been
      recently promoted, to Captain, due to his experience fighting the
      Seanchan.  He now sides with <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> against
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Byar">Jaret Byar</a>,
      p. 16&mdash;Gaunt-faced
      second-in-command under <a href="#Dain">Dain Bornhald</a> over
      the army of Whitecloaks that came to the Two Rivers.  Byar held fierce
      loyalty to Dain's father, and transferred that loyalty to Dain when he
      died.  He has deep-set eyes.  Byar now sides with
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> against <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>; he
      has picked up some of Galad's morals in doing what's right no matter who
      it hurts.
  <li><a class="name" name="Dain">Dain Bornhald</a>,
      p. 17&mdash;Son of
      Geofram.  He now commands his
      own troops; he also plans to avenge his father's death.  He has a hatred
      of <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, since he thinks he had a hand in
      killing his father.  After being chased from the Two Rivers, he has
      taken sides with <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> against the new Lord Captain
      Commander, <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Asunawa">Rhadam Asunawa</a>,
      p. 17&mdash;Gray-haired, bony-fingered High Inquisitor of the Hand of the
      Light.  He wants every woman affiliated in any way with the White Tower
      hanged as of yesterday, every book that mentions Aes Sedai or the White
      Tower burned, and the very words banned.  He would have
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> hanged for her months in the Tower if
      <a href="#Niall">Niall</a> had let him.  He witnessed
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>'s killing of
      Omerna subsequent to Niall's murder.  He commands
      what Valda describes as an odd respect among the Children, even among
      those who despise the Questioners.
  <li><a class="name" name="Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,
      p. 18&mdash;Former Lord
      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, highest officer among
      the Children.  He was one of the great military commanders of the world,
      in company with <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      <a href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>,
      <a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a>, <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>,
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and several Aiel chiefs.  He was trying
      to get Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian so the Council of Nine
      would not invade both countries.  He also tried to expand Amadicia's
      borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His headquarters were in Amadicia, and
      he ruled there even above <a href="#Ailron">King Ailron</a>, although
      this was not spoken of openly.  Niall once offered a treaty with
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor, offering Whitecloak
      assistance to retake her throne in exchange for Whitecloak presence in
      Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence that Morgase had not allowed
      even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall was killed by his alleged
      Spymaster, Abdel Omerna, who claimed he had gone
      against everything the Children stood for by allowing Morgase to avoid
      being put to the question.  He was replaced by
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>, who also killed Omerna.  Rumor puts
      him dead in a duel or a skirmish.

      <a href="#Valda">Valda, Eamon</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</a>,
      p. 19&mdash;Former
      Queen of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She
      married Taringail Damodred, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard;
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>,
      a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the
      city when she found he was usurping her power.  The Daughter-Heir of
      Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and
      Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.  She was
      given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and
      still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously advised by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a> of the Red Ajah, who is
      now the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and
      when she learned that the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a> and the Children of the Light.  She
      was not aware that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> only wanted to give her
      country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she
      had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country
      back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own
      and trust no one.  She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack
      (Valda believes her to be dead) under her mother's first name,
      <a href="#Dorlain">Maighdin</a> to avoid instant recognition, and later
      became a maidservant to <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>; she told Faile that
      she was a lady's handmaid before coming into her service.  When Faile's
      group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now
      detained in their encampment.  Her sign is three golden keys.  A former
      member of the Queen's Guard, <a href="#Tallanvor">Martyn Tallanvor</a>,
      has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost
      unconsciously returning his attentions.  Her adopted son
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> believes her dead at the hands of Eamon
      Valda, and plans revenge on him.  Her son Gawyn believes her dead at the
      hands of the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and is only restrained
      from killing her by <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>'s command.  Her
      daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no
      plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true
      identity.

  <li><a class="name" name="Kashgar">Under-Lieutenant Kashgar</a>,
      p. 20&mdash;Lean Saldaean
      Child of the Light.  He serves as an Under-Lieutenant.  His features are
      almost boyish, and he has a hooked nose and thick mustaches.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bryne">Lord Gareth Bryne</a>,
      p. 21&mdash;Former First
      Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards under
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> in Andor.  He was appointed to the
      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled
      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>.  He moved to his private estates in
      rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who
      unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, the former
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>;
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>, the former
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, and
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once there, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,
      <a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a>,
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      <a href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>, and
      <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He planned to be the
      first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else
      ever came was with Guaire Amalasan's armies, who
      got as far as the White Tower itself, and
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne thought he will be able to overcome this
      problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> brought the entire army to Tar Valon by
      Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he is pressuring her to let him
      use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city.  He is stocky,
      with a bluff face.  The years have given him some sort of comforting
      calmness.  Men always follow him&mdash;they have learned from history
      that doing so is the path to military victory.  Bryne taught
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> to practice
      the sword with both hands alternating to avoid weakness.

  <li><a class="name" name="Haslin">Henre Haslin</a>,
      p. 21&mdash;Former
      Master of the Sword for the Queen's Guards in Caemlyn.  He
      was too old for campaigning, so <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a> handed
      him his pension and showed him the gate to get him out of the way.  When
      news of <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s death, he started drinking.  He
      believes that Gaebril killed her, and is willing to teach
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s students at the Black Tower.  He also
      instructed <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> in
      the sword, and taught them the Oneness.
  <li><a class="name" name="Doirellin">Doirellin</a>,
      p. 26&mdash;Cairhienin
      Child of the Light with a high-pitched voice.  No one <em>ever</em>
      makes fun of his voice; he is nearly as wide as he is tall and has
      barely an ounce of fat on him.  He can crack walnuts by squeezing them
      in his hand.
  <li><a class="name" name="Rodel">Lord Rodel Ituralde</a>,
      p. 28&mdash;General of
      the army of Arad Doman.  He is one of the greatest commanders alive,
      along with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>,
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>,
      <a href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>, and a few Aiel clan chiefs.
      He keeps a neatly-trimmed mustache, and a ruby in his left ear.  He is
      short in stature.  He is called the Wolf by his peers&mdash;when the
      Wolf calls, they follow his lead.  He is currently leading a band of
      Taraboners and Domani to wreak havoc among the Seanchan.
  <li><a class="name" name="Tamsin">Tamsin Ituralde</a>,
      p. 30&mdash;<a href="#Rodel">Rodel</a>'s wife.  It is unwise to displease
      her, especially by getting killed, according to him.
  <li><a class="name" name="Lanasiet">Tornay Lanasiet</a>,
      p. 30&mdash;Stocky

      eager to attack the Seanchan.
  <li><a class="name" name="Jaalam">Jaalam Nishur</a>,

      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the man known as the Dragon
      during the War of the Shadow.  Over the years, many men have claimed to
      be the Dragon Reborn, even men who could not channel.  The true Dragon
      has been Reborn in a young man named <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, a
      shepherd from Emond's Field.

      p. 34&mdash;High Lady of Asinbayar and Barsabba, leader of Those Who Come
      Before.  She has her head shaven on the sides and long, black hair in
      the middle.  This is the typical Seanchan style for those &ldquo;of the
      Blood.&rdquo;  Suroth was determined to redeem herself after
      High Lord Turak's mishap at Falme&mdash;she did
      not want to have to explain a failure that was not hers to the
      <a href="#Empress">Empress</a>.  She gathered all of the Seanchan ships
      that fled Falme so they would not go back home; she then retook portions
      of the mainland again, but was prevented from taking Illian by
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and his Asha'man.  Known to few, Suroth is
      <i>Atha'an Shadar</i>, &ldquo;Those Bound to Shadow&rdquo;
      (a Darkfriend), and is high in their ranks.
  <li><a class="name" name="Tuon">High Lady Tuon Athaem Kore Paendrag</a>,
      p. 35&mdash;Second daughter of <a href="#Empress">Empress Radhanan</a>,
      heir to the Crystal Throne of Seanchan, and leader of the
      <i>Corenne</i>, the Return.  She has brown eyes and black hair (it was
      shaven off as is the custom of those of the High Blood).  She
      is also called the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, the
      woman <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> was told he will marry.  Mat has since
      kidnapped her (in a matter of speaking), and she travels with him under
      strictest secrecy.  She is very small&mdash;short and slender.  She is,
      however, 20 years old, about the same age as Mat.  She has very long
      eyelashes.  She is presumed dead by <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a>, but
      Suroth is taking no chances and has sent parties out to find her.

  <li><a class="name" name="Tylin">Queen Tylin Quintara Mitsobar</a>,
      p. 35&mdash;By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Altara, Mistress of the
      Four Winds, Guardian of the Sea of Storms, High Seat of House Mitsobar.
      Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was
      governed by nobles who were not necessarily loyal to her.  She was the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this was the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by
      <a href="#Merilille">Merilille Ceandevin</a> of the Gray Ajah.  She was
      a widow, and does not plan to marry again.  She took an interest in
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat's usual tactic of
      chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>.  The
      two were lovers for some time.  When the Seanchan invaded her nation,
      she cooperated with them out of necessity&mdash;they let her keep her
      position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne.
      When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in
      the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city,
      and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain
      her to escape.  While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the
      <i>gholam</i> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to
      it.  She was found by <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a>'s people the next
      morning, torn limb-from-limb.

      escaped, she put an <i>a'dam</i> around Renna's neck, and left it there
      when she fled.  Renna was later discovered by

      <i>sul'dam</i>, but was forbidden to be linked with a <i>damane</i>.

      eventually spirited away by <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,

      Ebou Dar in the chaos.  When she attempted to escape and warn the
      Seanchan of Mat's presence, Mat was forced to order her to be killed.
      She was killed by a crossbow bolt just before reaching the crest of the
      hill that would have meant her safety&mdash;and her betrayal of the
      Band of the Red Hand.

      Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was
      sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came

      killed by Liandrin by poison, which caused her eyes to bulge and her
      face to turn blue before the end.  Liandrin killed her because she
      thought she could curry favor with Suroth by doing so.  Suroth was not

      p. 46&mdash;One of the

      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and

      tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly say that Warders
      would make a Red sister's job easier.  She and her friend since
      novicehood, <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>, began a hunt for Darkfriends
      in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends,
      but because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends when she was

      being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be
      able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family
      and others like them.  She now leads the organization of sisters in the

      beaten out of her by <a href="#Galina">Galina Casban</a>; she and Galina
      were pillow friends as novices and/or Accepted, but Tarna rebuffed her
      advances once she gained the shawl.  She is as

      says at one point that Galina &ldquo;knew [her] Ajah long before [she]

      speculation, but I think it was the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina
      knew she would choose.  It certainly fits with the idea of most Aes
      Sedai in the Tower being Black, and with Galina's personal interest in
      Tarna.  However, it has also been revealed that Galina's interest in
      Tarna was more personal.</i>

  <li><a class="name" name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>,
      p. 50&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She
      occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she
      had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon
      Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of
      Andor for her entire reign.  She later led the coup that deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in
      Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds
      do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the
      Blue Ajah again.  Her <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> was
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would
      not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would
      have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of
      Siuan.  Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family
      during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going
      on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became
      clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another of her
      Foretellings was to predict that <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> would
      shake the world on its very foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks
      herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front of
      her, little more than a farmboy at the time.  Her most recent
      Foretelling was that &ldquo;the White Tower would be whole again, except
      for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever.
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her
      anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will
      walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly
      accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family
      was not certain.  It may have meant Morgase,
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, and
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>,
      Taringail, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was
      stilled and Healed), <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few others could match her
      strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to
      follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last
      Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar
      control.  The only sisters that support her are those that are actually
      Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as
      Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were
      stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually
      <i>did</i> shatter).  Elaida is currently building a palace for herself
      atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building will be about as tall
      as the White Tower.  She has no plans on being merciful on those who
      rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&mdash;her terms are that the
      Blue Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must
      serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the
      Tower.  Elaida has since replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of
      the Red Ajah, <a href="#Tarna">Tarna</a>, and she has suspicions that
      Alviarin was trying to commit treason against the Tower.

      of the Red Ajah, now taken prisoner by the Shaido.  She has actually
      been of the Black Ajah for all but five of her almost ninety years
      wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among the Black sisters.
      She and <a href="#Tarna">Tarna</a> were pillow friends as novices or Accepted;
      Tarna refused her advances after gaining the shawl&mdash;she had since
      come to realize that she prefers the attentions of men, despite her
      choice of the Red Ajah.
      She led the expedition to bring <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> to Tar Valon after
      he was shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at
      Dumai's Wells, and is now a prisoner of <a href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</a>
      and <a href="#Therava">Therava</a>.  Galina has long black hair without

      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a>'s as a Black sister&mdash;one
      (<a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>) was deposed and stilled, and the
      other (Tamra Ospenya) was made to appear that she
      had died in her sleep.  She led the circle that stilled Siuan.
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a> firmly did not want to believe that Galina
      was Black, despite <a href="#Talene">Talene</a>'s suspicions that she
      was.  When Galina's loyalties were proven, presumably by an
      inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage
      for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands.
      Galina now serves Sevanna and often shares her tent.  She is pretty, but
      nowhere near beautiful.  The White Tower presumes her to be dead at the
      battle of Dumai's Wells.

  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 54&mdash;The leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She, in theory,
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&ldquo;&mdash;all previous affiliations with
      Ajah are ignored (at least in principle).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly
      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions.
      No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since
      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day, except for
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she
      was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her successor was the leader of
      the coup, <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, raised from
      the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction
      opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of
      choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>, who was outside the Tower and not
      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene

      She was the daughter of a Lugard furniture maker,
      and is a bit above average height.  When the Hall was arguing
      over who to raise as <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> years back, it was
      deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty
      years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or
      more years than were common.  Seaine suggested
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for only
      ten years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida
      hopes to expose <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> on the suspicion that
      she is Black Ajah.  She and her friend since novicehood,
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a>, have successfully captured and bound with
      the Oath Rod a member of the Black Ajah, and have since dug out more
      Black sisters, even revealing that <a href="#Galina">Galina Casban</a>,
      head of the Red Ajah herself, was secretly Black.
      Seaine recently found that she was set to her task because of a
      misunderstanding:  Elaida asked her how she was getting along
      &ldquo;with discovering proof that Alviarin entered a treasonous
      correspondence with the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.&rdquo;
      Elaida's exact words were, &ldquo;We can never be sure who has the
      shadow of treason in her heart, Seaine.  Why, I suspect that someone
      arranged for an order of mine to be countermanded.  And I have reason
      to believe that someone has communicated privately with
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>; to what end, I cannot say,
      but that surely is treason against me, and against the Tower.
      I charge you to follow the stench of treason,
      no matter where it leads or how high,
      even to the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper</a> herself.  Yes, even to her.
      What you find, whoever it leads to,
      you will bring before the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> alone,
      Seaine.  No one else must know.&rdquo;
      Seaine interpreted this to mean Darkfriends in the Tower,
      and therefore assumed Elaida could not be a Darkfriend.
      She and her associates are no longer so sure.

      against <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her support
      among the sisters.  If Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, nothing
      will save either of them.  Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by
      <a href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</a>, and one of her first uses of it brought
      her to Tremalking for several weeks, during which Elaida removed her as
      Keeper.  She appears to know that the Aes Sedai sent back from Salidar
      are spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with
      <a href="#Meidani">Meidani</a>, who was one of them.  She has since been
      estranged from the White Ajah; her fellow Whites blame her for
      destroying their connection to the Amyrlin, and humiliating herself and
      her Ajah in the process.  She has since been sent to
      <a href="#Silviana">Silviana</a> for daily beatings.

      The Keeper is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah the

      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is
      essentially trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black
      sister raised in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to
      overstep <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> because she has a hard time thinking of
      Egwene being anything more than the frightened novice that came to her

      can be chosen, but no one sees that event occuring in the near future.
      She has green eyes.  She knows that the easiest way to power for herself

      marrying <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> (against his will) to gain power

      he and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the
      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <i>ta'veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very
      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other
      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helps considerably
      when helping Master Luhhan on his forge, but
      sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He
      returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc
      attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the
      first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he
      returned, he began to draw the eye of
      <a href="#Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</a>,
      the First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more
      than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no
      for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was
      instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the
      two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to
      leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as
      it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame
      <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>.  On the way, his wife was captured by
      Shaido, and now he must track her down.  He has a rope that he ties a
      knot in for every day she is held captive; he has plans in the making
      that should allow him to throw that cord away soon.

      Deira Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring.
      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      Mandarb was the name of <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> while
      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.
      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and
      that both he and Perrin are <i>ta'veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewings of
      Perrin.  She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she
      can to make sure he not so much as <i>looks</i> at another woman, even
      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,
      especially toward people like <a href="#Berelain">Berelain</a> who eye
      her husband all the time.  She even cornered <a href="#Min">Min</a> when
      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure
      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to
      find <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>, and while he was away her party was
      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <i>gai'shain</i> by them.
      She and the servants captured with her are planning an escape.  She is
      now a personal servant of <a href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</a>, and she
      seems to be one of Sevanna's favorites&mdash;for both service and

      p. 74&mdash;Young man from

      red-blond hair.  He was raised by <a href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</a> and his
      wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      Laman's Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      Shaiel, who was actually
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</a>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of
      Andor.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy; &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the Old.&rdquo;  Rand has a heron branded into each of his
      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <i><a href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      He Who Comes With the Dawn,
      the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <a href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <i>ta'veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place
      inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least
      expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes
      babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from
      him.   Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <i>ta'veren</i> during his turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      and <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>.  Rand has had success in fighting
      many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a> at the Eye of the World after the
      Green Man killed
      Balthamel; he allowed
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> to kill
      <a href="#Belal">Be'lal</a> in the Stone of Tear, and killed
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      <a href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate; <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> met his fate while
      fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar; and
      <a href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</a>, the reincarnation of
      <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was
      cleansing <i>saidin</i>.  During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered
      a mysterious wanderer, presumably <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>, who
      helped him.  During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided,
      causing Rand's head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a
      while.  Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing
      <i>saidin</i>; it is not known if this is because of Moridin's presumed
      use of the True Power, or something else.
      Rand's prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already
      been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <i>Callandor</i>, and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten
      symbol,&rdquo; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; (i.e., the White
      Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes
      Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He recently used the
      Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa'angreal</i> created during the War of
      the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s taint from
      <i>saidin</i>.  He has created schools of sorts, more research

      Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his
      &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; for male channelers.  With <i>saidin</i> cleansed,
      the Asha'man are now safe from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s taint.
      The Asha'man themselves are not free from the Dark One's

      Asha'man, including <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>, the leader of the
      Black Tower.  The Asha'man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to
      kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they
      were acting with Taim's knowledge.  Rand is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <i>will</i> save the
      world&mdash;and Break it again.

      p. 77&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Blue Ajah with shoulder-length hair.  Born in Tear to a fisherman,
      she was sent to the White
      Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the
      ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she
      was good friends with <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and was
      present at Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the
      Rebirth of the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  After being raised to the
      shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and
      guiding the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and eventually came to
      lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being
      raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to that point.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <a href="#Min">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close by to <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named Alric, but he
      died when she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She now serves
      as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>, but though she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious
      to this fact.  She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.

  <li><a class="name" name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>,

      woman from Emond's Field, now raised to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>
      among the Aes Sedai opposing <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>.  She
      has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be
      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also
      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the
      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.  Egwene is good friends with
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is
      also a childhood friend of <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all
      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost
      sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get
      married, and do not want to.  Egwene is the love object of both of
      Elayne's brothers, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,
      but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene
      was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when
      the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be
      guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they
      made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest
      Amyrlins in history.  Egwene has enlisted
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>
      as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove
      Elaida from power.  She has also opened the novice books to all
      interested women for the first time in history&mdash;in the past, they
      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women
      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased
      the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original,
      unified one.  The number of novices has increased to levels not known
      for over a thousand years.  Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents
      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of
      <i>cuendillar</i>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with
      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of
      <i>cuendillar</i> by <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> while she was
      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone.  She has recovered
      some other abilities through Moghedien as well.  She plans to reunite
      the Tower and make it stronger than ever&mdash;and she plans to start by
      exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into
      fragments that will never be gathered up again.

  <li><a class="name" name="Nynaeve">el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 84&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest
      such ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers
      were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>
      and <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  While the group traveled away from her home
      and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <i>a'dam</i> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and
      <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been
      passed to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> at the moment of Moiraine's
      death.  She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to
      pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife,
      she will become the Queen of Malkier when and if Lan raises the Golden
      Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the
      <i>ki'sain</i>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives,
      consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not
      tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took
      it up.  It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one
      second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  Because she was the only person Rand felt he
      could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to
      assist him when he cleansed <i>saidin</i>.  She now carries the
      <i>ter'angreal</i> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time.

  <li><a class="name" name="Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      p. 86&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Green Ajah.  She grew up in Arad Doman, and has coppery skin.  Just
      as her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani
      women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction:  she
      could channel <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.
      She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually
      raised to <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup
      led by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a> and
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first
      sister to ever switch Ajahs.  Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained
      by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.
      These spies are very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar
      Valon, but also what the Ajahs are leaving out of their reports to
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.  She has considerable strength with Earth,
      and is the second best at making <i>cuendillar</i>, after Egwene
      herself.  While carrying out Egwene's plan to turn the harbor chains to
      <i>cuendillar</i>, she was captured and is now being held in the
      dungeons below the Tower.

      She has already developed several Talents, including the ability to see
      <i>ta'veren</i> and Foretelling, although what she Foretells is usually
      in such language that only poets can understand it.  Her potential
      exceeds that of all Aes Sedai currently alive, with the exception of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, and Nynaeve.
      She has a limited ability to make <i>cuendillar</i>, but she is

      she once tried to blackmail <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a>, and <a href="#Nisao">Nisao</a>.  She
      used the fact that she could Foretell to be even more arrogant and
      demand even more special treatment.  When Egwene refused to grant her
      that treatment, she ran away to the White Tower, thinking they would let
      her progress at the pace she wanted.  She could not have been more
      incorrect, of course, and her life in the Tower is no doubt even more
      abysmal than it was before.  It will get even worse if a sister ever
      finds out that she lied about her age; she is too old to be entered into
      the novice book by Tower law.

  <li><a class="name" name="Min">Elmindreda (Min)  Farshaw</a>,
      p. 105&mdash;Young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that few
      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,
      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha'man, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,
      one of which was herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for
      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She
      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she
      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is
      one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</a>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a
      Warder bond that she shares with the other two,
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a> and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  She
      is fond of reading books by the late <a href="#Fel">Herid Fel</a>, a
      philosopher who worked in Rand's school of thought and was killed by a
      <i>gholam</i> or Slayer, presumably because he had stumbled upon
      information crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.  She had a viewing of
      Elayne just before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant
      with twins; she told half the palace before Elayne herself

      p. 119&mdash;Name used in

      Creation, Shai'tan was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.  This
      prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes
      Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were discovered, they were found:  1) At
      the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <a href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</a>, later pilfered by
      High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in Saldaea (still

      barely manage one big enough to walk through.  She instructed
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> when Egwene was a novice in the White

  <li><a class="name" name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 126&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is
      Taringail Damodred's youngest half-sister, and
      King Laman's niece.  She is considered short among
      her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was
      discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to
      Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> witnessed
      Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, along with two more <i>ta'veren</i>,
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>.
      When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <a href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Blight; she asked Lan
      to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is very strong in the Power,
      stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In the Stone of Tear,
      Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <a href="#Belal">Be'lal</a> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <i>ter'angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> through the twisted
      doorway <i>ter'angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land of the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a> still thinks she
      &ldquo;bungled&rdquo; things with Rand.

      instead of just making it happen.  The Forsaken and most Darkfriends
      consider Him to be inferior to the Dark One, despite the fact that He
      imprisoned the Dark One.

      realized she loved <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what

      but now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,

      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter'angreal</i>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion
      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.  In the
      meantime, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <i>ter'angreal</i>,
      something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of
      the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between
      three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel
      tradition, and Min.  Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant
      with Rand's twins.  To protect the children, she is not revealing the
      father of the twins.  She is proving to be a capable leader, one her
      people may eventually be proud of.

      be the story of his life.  He was born Barid Bel Medar one day after
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, and from the first day
      proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments, almost equal
      Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never surpass him in
      everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest generals, once again
      second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred believed that he was
      Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior, and was furious when
      Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces over him during the
      War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and
      finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews
      Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war since
      Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel
      Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed.
      When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of
      Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.  Demandred was recently told by the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to convert or destroy

      succeeded.  However, since <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> has been

      She spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated
      her life to the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  During the War of Power,
      she created &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for the children, at which she taught
      the children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her
      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where
      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.
      She has been cooperating with <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> to some

      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their

      coerced by <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> into coming with her,

      <i>sa'angreal</i> buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together
      could Break the World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male
      statue, but was thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  He then became Rand's teacher, and went
      into hiding from the rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if

      Rahvin was confronted and killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> in

      biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went over to the
      Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments he wanted
      to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar, <i>gholam</i>,
      Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other Forsaken think he
      was insane, for only someone insane would create some of the creatures
      he did.  He was the second one to be released from the sealing on the
      Bore, after Balthamel.  He was trapped close to
      the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded from the passing of time
      very effectively; he emerged as a very old man, so old that his face was
      wrinkled so that one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was
      killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World.  Unbeknownst
      to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Aginor was reincarnated in
      the body of a Borderlander man and given the new name
      <a href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</a>.  Osan'gar masqueraded as
      Corlan Dashiva, one of the Asha'man, until he was
      killed at the cleansing of <i>saidin</i> by
      <a href="#Elza">Elza Penfell</a> and her circle.
      One of Aginor's creations was the
      <i>zomara</i>, androgynous not-quite-human servants; they are almost
      useless for any other task.  <a href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</a> describes
      them as one of Aginor's &ldquo;less inspired creations.&rdquo;

  <li><a class="name" name="Ishamael">Ishamael</a>,
      p. 142&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and during the Age
      of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian named Elan
      Morin Tedronai.  He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>
      to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from eachother's throats.  He confronted
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s bonds; he confronted him again
      at Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <i>Callandor</i> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba'alzamon,
      which he called himself to the public, was a human being, and not the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.
      There is little doubt that Ishamael has been resurrected in
      the person of the mysterious <a href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</a>,

      in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore.  The
      sport fell from common practice, since almost invariably both duelists
      died from the slow poison on the daggers.  Osan'gar states that he
      helped make the Trollocs, indicating that in his past life he was

  <li><a class="name" name="Lanfear">Lanfear</a>,
      p. 143&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile, and was
      very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out
      to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</a>, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <i>ter'angreal</i> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, becoming trapped.  Lanfear has since
      been reincarnated as <a href="#Cyndane">Cyndane</a> and fitted with a
      <i>cour'souvra</i>, a Mind Trap, held by <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>.

      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> thinks she can count on for her support.
      She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman and pale silver-colored
      hair.  She is from Shienar, and has no Warder.  Lately, Delana has been
      causing trouble in the Hall, especially with her demands to make a
      formal declaration that <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> is Black Ajah.  She
      is willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters
      will not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her
      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of
      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named

      Forsaken.  Her name means &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  She
      always works from safety, attacks from safety, and will run unless she
      can do so.  She developed a command of <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> that
      surpassed even <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>'s mastery&mdash;in the
      real world, Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top
      Moghedien in the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore,
      Moghedien eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the
      Panarch of Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>, who was trying to save the
      Panarch at the time and take the seal on the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison from its hold in the Palace.
      She and Nynaeve fought in a duel to the last,
      and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off
      shield, and on their next encounter, this one in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>,
      she ripped <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a>'s soul out of the World of
      Dreams after Birgitte almost killed her.  On her third encounter with
      Nynaeve, Nynaeve managed to trap Moghedien with an <i>a'dam</i>.
      Moghedien remained bound by that <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar, disguised as
      Marigan, but was released by
      <a href="#Halima">Halima</a>.  Halima was actually one of the Forsaken,
      and she took Moghedien to Shayol Ghul to be bound by a

      p. 148&mdash;The
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He was perhaps the
      greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai in recorded
      history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the forces of the Light
      against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which re-sealed the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.  Unfortunately,
      during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch,
      eventually killing his wife <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</a>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      Kinslayer.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice often speaks inside
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who can channel.  It even tries to
      seize control of <i>saidin</i> sometimes, much to Rand's fear&mdash;Rand
      is certain that Lews Therin cannot take control of <i>saidin</i> away
      from him if he seizes it first, but he is almost as certain that if Lews
      Therin seizes it first, he will not be able to snatch it back.

  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 149&mdash;Young
      man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>.  Along with his good
      friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after
      Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat's <i>ta'veren</i> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including Eldrin
      and <a href="#Bode">Bodewhin</a>, who are 16 and 17, respectively.  His
      father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was
      not the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was
      also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to
      die and live again.&rdquo;  He created an army called the Band of the
      Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old
      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and
      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a
      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there he was
      cornered by <a href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</a>, who gave him little choice
      but to become her lover.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle
      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so
      it looked &ldquo;official&rdquo;&mdash;Tylin was found torn limb from
      limb, obviously by the <i>gholam</i> which was no doubt sent to kill
      Mat.  In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <i>sul'dam</i>
      and <i>damane</i> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and
      even kidnapped <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>, the
      <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a> herself.
      Mat is traveling with <a href="#Luca">Valan Luca</a>'s

      p. 196&mdash;<i>Sul'dam</i> who was left behind after the battle at
      Falme, later captured by <a href="#Tamarath">Egeanin</a>.  When Egeanin
      found her, she tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the <i>a'dam</i>
      she was carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier
      to the woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the
      <i>a'dam</i> should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring
      around her head).  Much to Egeanin's surprise, the <i>a'dam</i> held
      Bethamin just as well as it held the <i>damane</i> it was intended for.
      Bethamin already knew this, from observing <a href="#Renna">Renna</a>,
      who <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> left collared after Falme.  From this,
      and from <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>'s and
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>'s information about the possibility of
      learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that
      all <i>sul'dam</i>, including Bethamin, could channel if they were
      taught&mdash;which went against everything she had been taught her
      entire life.  Bethamin is now forbidden to be linked to <i>damane</i>,
      both as protection for her&mdash;if anyone besides
      <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a> knew that the <i>a'dam</i> would control
      her, they would probably make her wear it all the time&mdash;and as
      protection for the Seanchan way of life, which would likely collapse if
      it was learned that <i>sul'dam</i> could channel just as well as
      <i>damane</i>.  She has since been spirited away from Ebou Dar

      p. 203&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair.  She retired
      to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the
      difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to
      be.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when
      refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of
      the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most
      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand
      years except perhaps for <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  Although she is a Green, she has
      confronted and captured more men that can channel than any other woman;
      unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being
      gentled than the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes
      Sedai.  According to <a href="#Min">Min</a>, Cadsuane will teach
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not
      like it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.  She
      is the oldest Aes Sedai alive.  Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her
      hair, all of which are <i>ter'angreal</i> she has collected over the
      years.  One of them is a reservoir&mdash;it &ldquo;stores&rdquo;
      <i>saidar</i> for later use in places where one might not be able to tap
      the Source, such as inside an Ogier <i>stedding</i> or inside Far
      Madding, her hometown.  Another vibrates in the presence of men who can
      channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so
      many men to be gentled.  There are many others, including three that she
      does not know the purpose of.  <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> suspects
      Cadsuane may be a Darkfriend, but based on her actions and thoughts so
      far that seems unlikely.  <a href="#Verin">Verin</a> told Rand that she

      Cadsuane has, reluctantly, agreed to be Rand's advisor, provided he
      adheres to a proper level of conduct.

      He led the other half of the Band of the Red Hand's cavalry, the part

  <li><a class="name" name="Talmanes">Talmanes Delovinde</a>,
      p. 219&mdash;Cairhienin military commander, about three years older than
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> and about a head shorter.  His <i>con</i> is
      three yellow stars on a blue field.  His banner is a black fox.  He
      rarely smiles, and reminds Mat of a compressed spring.  He commands
      about half of Mat's cavalry in the Band of the Red Hand, and acts as the
      leader of the entire Band in Mat's absence.  He is skinny, and has gray
      hair.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</a>,
      p. 220&mdash;Former Panarch of Tarabon.  She vanished, allegedly at

      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under
      <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a>, and was rescued by
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch's Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquo;), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan
      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new
      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.  She
      served as a dancer for <a href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</a>, the
      leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces, until she was rescued by
      <a href="#Juilin">Juilin Sandar</a>, who took her along when he fled
      Ebou Dar with <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.  She and Juilin have become an
      item since that time; he has been training her, with limited success, to
      stop flinching every time a Seanchan officer walks by.

      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a
      one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He
      fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He
      was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at
      least changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, and

      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea
      Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private;
      for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public.
      Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai
      she accompanies.  According to the Wise Ones,
      <i>Aan'allein</i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the
      day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.  He is one of the best, if not
      <i>the</i> best, warriors (and Warders) in the World.

  <li><a class="name" name="Aviendha">Aviendha</a>,
      p. 310&mdash;Aiel of the
      Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,
      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had
      the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of age with
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.  She is more than
      pretty with her dark reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women
      in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that she was
      to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in
      Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the
      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she
      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,
      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could
      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the
      night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar
      incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about
      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of
      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She
      felt <i>toh</i> toward <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> for violating her
      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her
      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once
      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second</i>
      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has
      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the
      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is
      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.
      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&mdash;a feat which
      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She
      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a
      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely
      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one
      could do so without her knowing it immediately.

      eyes, straight black hair, a round face, and is very imposing.
      Unfortunately, Sumeko's abilities in Healing have caused her to

      rescued from Aringill by <a href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</a>'s men, her
      claim vanished.  Her House now supports Arymilla for the Lion
      Throne and the Rose Crown of Andor.  However, she thinks Arymilla
      &ldquo;lacks the wit&rdquo; to be queen, and Elayne too
      immature&mdash;she is also not above causing &ldquo;accidents&rdquo;

      opposed <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  Slender
      and strong, he is the High Seat of House Baryn.  He was exiled from the
      Palace except for official functions by Morgase after she took the Lion
      Throne, but he invited himself back when <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> forced
      <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a> out of town.  He has since been exiled

      She was banished from the Palace grounds except for state occasions for
      opposing <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Third War of Andoran
      Succession during which Morgase came to power.  When
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> killed <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>, she came
      to him and tried to win his favor&mdash;she only wants to advance her
      own power and influence in Andor.  She has since been re-exiled from the

      p. 380&mdash;<a href="#Elenia">Elenia</a>'s husband, the High Seat of House
      Sarand.  A square-faced man, he is dark for an Andorman.  During the
      Succession, Jared's House opposed <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>; after
      she became Queen, he was only allowed into the Palace on state
      occasions.  When <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> killed
      <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a> and took control of Caemlyn until he
      could find <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, Jarid tried to make himself
      fall into favor, thinking he could gain power with the new ruler.  He
      and his wife have been exiled, and now support
      <a href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</a>'s claim to the Lion Throne, but if
      Elenia attempts to claim the throne for herself, Elayne expects him to
      assist her.  He is very honorable, almost too much so.

      from limb, presumably by a <i>gholam</i> or by

      now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted stone
      ring <i>ter'angreal</i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> that there was really no need to keep her

      never flashed her temper at Lews Therin when she got angry at herself.
      Lews Therin often wails for her loss for hours on end; these rants are

      the head of Rand's school of male channelers, now dubbed the Black
      Tower.  He is almost as strong in the One Power as Rand is.  Taim claims
      to have held off the madness that normally accompanies the taint for
      almost 35 years&mdash;he has been using the One Power for a very long
      time, and knows many tricks that Rand had not thought of on his own or
      been taught by <a href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</a>, such as how to test men
      for the ability.  He seems to resent being second to Rand, and also gave
      orders to kill Rand.  He is almost as tall as Rand, has a hooked nose
      and dark eyes.  He is a physically powerful and graceful man, although
      his skill with a sword is lacking.  He gives special training to about
      20 or 30 men&mdash;they are the only ones who wear the dragon besides
      <a href="#Logain">Logain</a>.  There is also little doubt that every

      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from

      Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear
      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak

      through to raise money for the ever-growing army.  She has been an Aes
      Sedai only 35 years, which is too young to be a sitter&mdash;most sitters
      have worn the shawl over 100 years by the time they become sitters.  She
      thinks it is wrong to sell objects made from <i>cuendillar</i> that they
      have just made recently.  She also thinks the Yellows are being unfairly
      drawn from Healing to make the objects (as if her Ajah's duty was more
      important than that of other Ajahs).

      her making objects out of <i>cuendillar</i>.  She is plump-cheeked and
      pretty.  She wears her hair in a dark braid, though Egwene suspects she
      did not have the Women's Circle's permission to do so&mdash;it does not
      matter anymore, however, as she is not in Emond's Field anymore.

      that she keeps in a tight bun at the back of her head.  She ran a very

      children) grew up.  She seems to have adopted all of the novices as

      Egwene's tent.  She is stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a
      perfect face and a full, firm bosom.  As she is posing as a poorly
      educated serving girl, she forms her letters with the awkwardness of a

      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that

      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn
      managed to kill both of them.  With recent developments, Gawyn does not
      know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who opposed
      Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same
      time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in

      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> side with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is
      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no
      telling how he'll react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love
      him (and is carrying his twins), as well as that Egwene heads the
      rebellion against the Tower.  His sign is a white boar.

      the Province of Andor until Hawkwing's empire finally fell apart and
      Andor became an independent nation.  All of the Andoran nobles are
      related to her somehow, although most people would not even consider
      the ones who hold the closest relation to her to be related at all.
      None of her sons lived past age twenty, hence the tradition of only
      having a queen in Andor.

      step up from Swordmaster among the Sea Folk.  It is the highest position
      a man can hold amoung them.  He protects the

  <li><a class="name" name="Mordrellen">Queen Mordrellen Mantear</a>,
      p. 781&mdash;By
      the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the
      Realm, etc. before <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>.  Her death and the
      previous disappearance of her daughter <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>
      set off the Succession, called the Third War of Andoran Succession by
      those not from Andor.  Her advisor was
      Gitara Moroso
      of the Blue Ajah.  She is, unknown to everyone except
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> himself, Rand's grandmother.  <i>Editor's note:
      her name is actually listed as Queen Modrellein by Dyelin in other
      books. I have little idea which one is actually correct, so I just
      picked this spelling.  There is also a reference made to the character
      of Modrellein as the hero of Andor who rode into the middle of the
      battle 700 years ago, reversed the retreat, rallied the army, and won
      the battle&mdash;I think this is probably who she was confused
      with.</i>

      p. 781&mdash;First
      wife of Taringail Damodred, and
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>'s mother.  She was the
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir</a> to the Throne of Andor and daughter of
      <a href="#Mordrellen">Queen Mordrellen</a>, but she disappeared.  Her
      disappearance set of the Third War of Andoran Succession.  When
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, several
      people commented on his striking resemblance to Tigraine; this is no
      coincidence, since Tigraine is Rand's mother.  She fled to the Aiel
      Waste upon a warning from Gitara Moroso to become
      a Maiden of the Spear, and gave birth to Rand when the Aiel were
      fighting near Tar Valon.  Her maiden name was Mantear.
