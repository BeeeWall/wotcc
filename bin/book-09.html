      p. 9 (xi)&mdash;Name of the black horse that
      winter's heart shall ride when &ldquo;the seals that hold back
      night weaken,&rdquo; according to <i>The Karaethon Cycle</i>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Dragon">The Dragon</a>,
      p. 9 (xi)&mdash;Name by which <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> was known by
      during the War of the Shadow.  His Rebirth, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>,
      is alive and fulfilling all of the Prophecies set to signal
      his return.

  <li><a class="name" name="Seaine">Seaine Herimon</a>,
      p. 15 (1)&mdash;Sitter for the White Ajah in Tar Valon.  When the Hall was
      arguing over who to raise as <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> years back,
      it was deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about
      fifty years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty
      or more years than were common.  Seaine suggested
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for ten
      years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida
      hopes to expose <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> on the suspicion that
      she is Black Ajah.  She and her friend since novicehood,
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a>, have successfully captured and bound with
      the Oath Rod a few members of the Black Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" name="Dark">Dark One</a>,
      p. 15 (1)&mdash;Name
      used in every land for Shai'tan, the source of all evil, complete
      antithesis of <a href="#Creator">The Creator</a> in every way.  At the
      moment of Creation, Shai'tan was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol
      Ghul.  This prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored
      into by Aes Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the
      Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the
      War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during
      which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their
      lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and
      were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War
      of the Shadow did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the
      Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were found, they were placed:  1) At the
      Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <a href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</a>, later pilfered by
      <a href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</a> of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <i>cuendillar</i>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
      The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including
      Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of
      Storms, Shepherd of the Night, Soulblinder, and (among Darkfriends) the
      Great Lord of the Dark.

  <li><a class="name" name="Ferane">Ferane Neheran</a>,
      p. 16 (2)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the White Ajah in Tar Valon.  She is the head of
      the White Ajah, or at least high in its ranks, according to observations
      by <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Jesse">Jesse Bilal</a>,
      p. 16 (2)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah in Tar Valon.  She is the head of
      the Brown Ajah, or at least high in its ranks, according to
      observations by <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Suana">Suana Dragand</a>,
      p. 16 (2)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah in Tar Valon.
      She is probably the head
      of the Yellow Ajah, by <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>'s observation.
  <li><a class="name" name="Saerin">Saerin Asnobar</a>,
      p. 16 (3)&mdash;Sitter for the
      Brown Ajah in Tar Valon from Altara.  She carries a curved knife, in the
      fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white at her dark
      temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only a Warder
      could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the Hall for
      forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150.  Everyone knows to be
      wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of an innkeeper, and was
      first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an organization similar to,
      but shorter-lived and smaller than, the Kin)&mdash;she was the only one
      of them to ever obtain the shawl.
  <li><a class="name" name="Pevara">Pevara Tazanovni</a>,
      p. 16 (3)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She is plump but tough.  She and her friend
      since novicehood, <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>, are now leading a hunt
      for Darkfriends in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because
      they were friends, but because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends
      when she was young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one
      which involved being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more
      likely to be able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that
      killed her family and others like them.

  <li><a class="name" name="Yukiri">Yukiri</a>,
      p. 17 (3)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is quite small, and is a Sitter for the
      Gray.
  <li><a class="name" name="Doesine">Doesine Alwain</a>,
      p. 17 (3)&mdash;Sitter for the Yellow Ajah in Tar Valon.  She looks more like a
      &ldquo;pretty boy&rdquo; than a reputable Yellow.  She grew up in
      Cairhien.
  <li><a class="name" name="Talene">Talene Minly</a>,
      p. 17 (3)&mdash;Golden-haired Sitter for the Green Ajah in Tar Valon.  She used
      to be <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>'s friend.  She has no Warders, which is
      extremely unusual for a Green.  When <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a>
      shielded her because she suspected her of being Black Ajah, she tried to
      stab her.  She actually <i>is</i> a member of the Black Ajah, and is now
      sworn to obey Pevara and Seaine unconditionally.

      <a href="#Seaine">Herimon, Seaine</a>;
      <a href="#Pevara">Tazanovni, Pevara</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah,
      now raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  She
      was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.
      As a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the
      Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor for her entire reign, and
      led the coup that deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and placed
      her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of
      her Ajah (as most Reds do), and doesn't believe she will ever trust any
      member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest.  Her
      Keeper of the Chronicles is
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&mdash;she was
      all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of
      Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not
      have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would have
      been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan.
      She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that
      strongly.  One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor
      would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling
      occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately
      attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be
      the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something
      about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the
      time.  Her most recent Foretelling was that &ldquo;the White Tower would
      be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and
      stronger than ever.  <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> will face the
      Amyrlin Seat and know her anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood
      and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling
      about Rand is obviously deadly accurate.  However, the one about the
      Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's
      Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain.  It may have meant
      Morgase, <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, Galad, and
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of Tigraine,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan,
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few
      others could match her strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of
      power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding
      the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an
      effort to gain similar control.  The only sisters that support her are
      those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any
      Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws
      used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and
      some believe they actually did shatter).  Elaida is currently building
      a palace for herself atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building
      will be about as tall as the White Tower.

  <li><a class="name" name="Zerah">Zerah Dacan</a>,
      p. 23 (11)&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the White Ajah.  She was one of the sisters sent back to Tar Valon by
      the Aes Sedai gathered in Salidar to spread news of
      <a href="#Logain">Logain</a>'s being set up by Reds as a false
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a> and attempt to build resistance to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> within the Tower.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bernaile">Bernaile Gelbarn</a>,
      p. 24 (12)&mdash;Aes Sedai of unknown Ajah.  She was one of the sisters sent back
      to Tar Valon by the Aes Sedai gathered in Salidar to spread news of
      <a href="#Logain">Logain</a>'s being set up by Reds as a false
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a> and attempt to build resistance to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> within the Tower.
  <li><a class="name" name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      p. 24 (12)&mdash;The Daughter-Heir of Andor, now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.
      She is the daughter of <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> and her late husband,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>, and sister to
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She is also half-sister to
      Galad, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>,
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, and told him how she
      felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo; but
      now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter'angreal</i>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion
      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.

  <li><a class="name" name="Nynaeve">el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 25 (13)&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an
      Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the
      youngest such ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her
      villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  While the group
      traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made
      several discoveries:  she could channel the One Power, and had already
      done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed
      feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king
      of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all
      of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come.  She is
      very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during
      the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still
      being trained.  When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted
      without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even
      <i>sense</i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to
      learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching.  She was
      sent on a false mission by <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a> on which she was almost
      leashed by the Seanchan as <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> was.  After she
      returned to the Tower, <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a
      mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while
      hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> and managed to better her in a duel
      of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once
      again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an
      <i>a'dam</i> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve took Moghedien with her
      to seek out <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a>
      while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before
      Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant
      weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it;
      the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and
      destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control
      with a modified <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar.  Nynaeve wished to become Aes
      Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in
      the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it.  She is
      determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already
      managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because
      her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their
      bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to
      <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> the moment of Moiraine's death.  She and
      Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to her as
      soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife, she will
      become the Queen of Malkier when and if Lan raises the Golden Crane and
      frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the <i>ki'sain</i>, an
      ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on
      the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not tell her of this
      tradition, but when she found out she immediately took it up.
      It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second
      when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <i>tel'aran'rhiod</i>.

  <li><a class="name" name="Vandene">Vandene Namelle</a>,
      p. 25 (13)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah, one of two Aes Sedai who went
      into voluntary retreat many years ago to Tifan's Well, a village located
      in the grassy plains of Arafel, along with her sister
      <a href="#Adeleas">Adeleas</a>.  Their goal was some day to write the
      complete history of the World since the Breaking, and some even before
      that.  Vandene and Adeleas came to Salidar to escape
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>'s summons back to the Tower.  They now
      travel with the Aes Sedai, Accepted, novices, and troops on their way to
      Tar Valon.

  <li><a class="name" name="Reanne">Reanne Corly</a>,
      p. 25 (13)&mdash;Eldest of the Knitting Circle, the ruling group among the women
      known as the Kin.  She has blue eyes, and is quite strong in the One
      Power; she could match Sheriam,
      Kwamesa, or <a href="#Kiruna">Kiruna</a>.  She
      claims to be 412 years old.  Publicly, she used to arrange shipping for
      small traders.  Since the Kin were brought out of Ebou Dar due to the
      Seanchan invasion, she has been working on getting the Kin who could not
      escape out before the Seanchan collar them.
  <li><a class="name" name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>,
      p. 25 (14)&mdash;A young woman from Emond's Field, now raised to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> among the Aes Sedai opposing
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>.  She has considerable strength with the
      One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in
      over a thousand years.  She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in
      almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this
      Talent.  Egwene is good friends with
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor,
      and is also a childhood friend
      of <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their
      youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other
      now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to.
      Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne's brothers,
      Galad and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>&mdash;she is
      flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them; she does
      find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder;
      she knows it will occur.  Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because
      the Aes Sedai thought she could be guided by them without too much
      trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene
      shows promise to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history.  Egwene
      has recently enlisted <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a> as the
      commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove Elaida from power.
      She has also opened the novice books to all interested women for the
      first time in history&mdash;in the past, they were only open to girls of
      a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the
      discipline.

      p. 29 (18)&mdash;Gleeman who came to Emond's Field on
      Winternight just before the Trollocs came.  He is quite the ladies' man.
      Thom is good at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other
      tricks.  He also carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his
      boots, and in various other locations on his body; this practice seems
      to have spread from Thom to <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>, and <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>.  Thom was
      originally a bard in <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a>'s Royal Court,
      and for a time after her husband
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a> died,
      he was the Queen's lover.  During his run from a Fade
      at Shadar Logoth, he was injured, and now walks with a limp because of
      it.  Thom is getting old, such that he is starting to realize that he
      cannot do the backflips and other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> on their

      fact that he has never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his
      nephew, Owyn, was gentled by the Red Ajah.
      Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in fact, his girlfried
      Dena was killed by Cairhienin
      soldiers because they thought he was trying to play <i>Daes Daemar</i>
      against the Royal House.

  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 29 (18)&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field.  He is <i>ta'veren</i>.  Along
      with his good friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attacks after Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a
      dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol,
      which he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the
      dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling,
      a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes
      that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <i>ta'veren</i> qualities
      manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice
      games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are
      weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling,
      and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he
      fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      Eldrin and <a href="#Bode">Bodewhin</a>, who are 16
      and 17, respectively.  His father Abell is one of
      the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.
      In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the
      Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she is not the
      <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to
      marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders
      from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill her to save his
      own skin, but regrets it deeply.  He also has a scar along his neck from
      where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was also in accordance
      with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to die and live
      again.&rdquo; He currently leads an army called the Band of the Red
      Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old
      Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, who
      has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does
      not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead
      medallion off even to take a bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep
      an eye on <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> and prevent them from getting themselves
      killed.  While there he was cornered by
      <a href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</a>,
      who gave him little choice but to become her lover.

      p. 31 (20)&mdash;Former First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's
      Guards under <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> in Andor.  He was
      appointed to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives,
      but was exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>.  He moved to his private estates
      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women
      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, the former
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>;
      Leane Sharif, the former
      Keeper of the Chronicles, and
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once there, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,
      Rodel Ituralde,
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      Agelmar Jagad, and
      <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He plans to be the first
      ever general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever
      came was with <a href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</a>'s armies, who got as
      far as the White Tower itself, and
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne believes he will be able to overcome this
      problem.

      p. 32 (21)&mdash;Young man from
      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair.  He was raised by Tam al'Thor and his
      wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      Laman's Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      Shaiel, who was actually
      Tigraine Damodred, the runaway Daughter-Heir of
      Andor.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy; &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the Old.&rdquo;  Rand has a heron branded into each of his
      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <i><a href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      He Who Comes With the Dawn,
      the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <a href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <i>ta'veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place
      inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least
      expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes
      babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from
      him.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <i>ta'veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within
      days (hours, even) of him named <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      and <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>.  Rand has had success in fighting
      many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.
      He killed Aginor at the Eye of the World after the
      Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> to kill Be'lal in
      the Stone of Tear, and killed <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> in the
      Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World,
      <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> confronted him and was pushed into the
      land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a>
      in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      and Asmodean, his teacher, was killed shortly
      after Rahvin met his fate.  His prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has
      already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the
      ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <i>Callandor</i>, and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten
      symbol,&rdquo; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo;
      (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him
      (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai
      have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He has also been bonded by
      <a href="#Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</a>, an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah,
      against his will&mdash;the first such bonding in hundreds of years.
      He plans to use the Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa'angreal</i>
      created during the War of the Shadow,
      to cleanse the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s
      taint from <i>saidin</i>.  He plans to do it soon, to prevent further
      problems with his Asha'man, men who came for his &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo;
      against male channelers, going mad.  He is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <i>will</i> save the
      world&mdash;and Break it again.

      of the Forsaken.  He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for
      being a ladies' man&mdash;he always had a woman on his arm.  After being
      released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>, and used Compulsion to have
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> not only make him her advisor, but
      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country
      directly as the first ever King of Andor&mdash;he did his best to weaken
      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who
      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly after
      news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien, Rahvin
      was confronted and killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> in
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn
      Rahvin's soul out of the pattern for hours, perhaps days.

  <li><a class="name" name="Morgase">Queen Morgase Trakand</a>,
      p. 32 (22)&mdash;Former Queen of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She married
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, a prince of Cairhien, to
      further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep peace between
      the two nations; when Tigraine disappeared,
      Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her widower to
      gain the support that would be gained by such action.  Taringail was
      Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.  Morgase has
      since gone through several lovers, including
      <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard;
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, her
      First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>, a man who led the faction that
      stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar
      Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the
      city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of
      some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally
      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being
      Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously
      advised by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a> of the Red
      Ajah, who is now the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.
      When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was
      actually <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a>) meant to supplant her, she left, and
      when she learned that the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a> and the Children of the Light.  She is
      not aware that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> only wanted to give her country
      back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she made her
      presence known, she would no doubt have her country back in one piece
      and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her
      own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase dead except for
      a select few.  She is currently in hiding, using her mother's name,
      <a href="#Dorlain">Maighdin</a> to avoid instant recognition, and a
      prisoner of the Shaido.  Her sign is three golden keys.

  <li><a class="name" name="Gawyn">Lord Gawyn Trakand</a>,
      p. 33 (22)&mdash;Son of <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor and brother
      to <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      Galad went to train with the Warders in the White Tower,
      as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now possess
      considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that erupted
      after <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band
      of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad,
      who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back against their
      teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and Leane
      from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself killed
      Hammar and Coulin, the men
      in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which were Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  With recent
      developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support&mdash;he
      believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and
      Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts
      surrounding the change in leadership.
      In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a> and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>
      side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the
      woman he wants to marry, is their new leader.  He believes the rumor
      that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> killed his mother, and only refrains from
      killing him because Egwene made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many
      enemies inside and outside the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.
      He detests Rand because he thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact
      no one did), and there is no telling how he will react when he finds out
      that Elayne loves him, as well as that Egwene heads the rebellion
      against the Tower.  His sign is a white boar.

      Wise One because she had the ability to channel inborn.  She has green
      eyes, and is of age with <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.  She is more than pretty with dark, reddish hair.
      Aviendha is one of the three women in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s
      viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that she was to fall in love with him
      when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean.  She denied her
      feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall
      toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as
      &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand came in as she was standing before
      the bath in her skin, and she panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway
      to Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from
      Rand as possible, into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she
      decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up
      spending the night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha
      says a similar incident will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who
      makes a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred
      on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject
      entirely).  She felt <i>toh</i> toward <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> for
      violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being
      her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand
      once again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second</i>
      sister-wife in Min, but she is determined to meet her before passing any
      judgment.  She has recently been having trouble learning Traveling
      again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it
      to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you
      already learned it another way.  She has, however, mastered the art of
      unraveling weaves&mdash;a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes
      Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.
      She and Elayne have plans to adopt each other as first-sisters.

      man besides <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> and

      His armies put down those of <a href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</a>,

      and he even sent troops across the Aryth
      Ocean under his son, <a href="#Luthair">Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin</a>,
      in hopes of conquering new lands there.  All contact with
      these armies ended with Hawkwing's death, which set off the War of the
      Hundred Years.  The descendants of the armies under Luthair have now
      returned to reclaim the lands of Hawkwing's empire in the Old
      World&mdash;they now call themselves the Seanchan.

  <li><a class="name" name="Min">Elmindreda (Min)  Farshaw</a>,
      p. 73 (71)&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She has a
      special ability that few besides herself know about:  she sees images
      and auras around people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that
      foretell their futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings
      mean, but when she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of
      how and when.  Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included herself:
      three women are destined to fall in love with him, one of which is
      herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men; this habit was
      picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner.
      However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began
      to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> with her viewings' information when Siuan was
      deposed, and it was Min who freed Siuan and Leane
      from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two former leaders of the Aes
      Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for Caemlyn with Salidar's
      embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought information to Rand about
      the embassy there, and its intentions.  She has only had one viewing
      that ever failed, which concerned <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>; since
      Moiraine is believed dead, she hopes that her viewings might be wrong at
      least once in a while.  Min is one of only two women that can rightfully
      call herself a lover to the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</a>.  She is
      fond of reading books by the late <a href="#Fel">Herid Fel</a>, a
      philosopher who worked in Rand's school of thought and was killed by a
      <i>gholam</i>, presumably because he had stumbled upon information
      crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.

      torn limb from limb by a <i>gholam</i>, or possibly by
      Slayer, for unknown reasons, although it
      is likely that he had stumbled upon something quite damaging to the

      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> (whom she bonded against his will) and
      <a href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</a>; her other, Owein, died
      in the Two Rivers while scouting the Whitecloak camp.  She later found
      that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it impossible to
      Compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it to attempting
      to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she constantly feels the
      pain he experiences from the wound in his side, perhaps even more
      severely than he feels it.
  <li><a class="name" name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 73 (71)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</a>, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      Kinslayer.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough for him to
      realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on
      <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where
      he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the
      present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of one
      of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews
      Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but without
      Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them.
      Lews Therin's voice often speaks inside <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>'s head,
      offering advice or sobbing over lost women or ranting about killing men
      who can channel.  It even tries to seize control of <i>saidin</i>
      sometimes, much to Rand's fear&mdash;Rand is certain that Lews Therin
      cannot take control of <i>saidin</i> away from him if he seizes it
      first, but he is almost as certain that if Lews Therin seizes it first,
      he will not be able to snatch it back.

      He is little taller than <a href="#Min">Min</a>, and has dark eyes and

      hair on the sides to his shoulders.  He rules Cairhien in

      presence.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 74 (72)&mdash;The leader of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.
      She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall
      of the Tower at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and
      weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their
      entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while
      there.  The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the
      Power and in her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be
      unanimous, as must the vote to depose one.  Once chosen the Amyrlin is
      said to be &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;all previous
      affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in principle).
      The Ajahs have gotten fairly
      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:
      no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since
      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was
      deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day, except for
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, the
      current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the
      average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last
      five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two
      exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only
      added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.
      The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the
      Keeper of the Chronicles,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The office was held by
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah,
      until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Her successor was the leader of the coup,
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, raised from the Red
      Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing
      Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides
      on the day Siuan was deposed:  <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>,
      who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan
      was deposed to the time Egwene was Raised.

      p. 76 (75)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair.
      She retired to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it
      due to the difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather the way
      it used to be.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower,
      when refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head
      of the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most
      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand
      years except perhaps for <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.
      Although a Green, she has confronted and captured more men that can

      to live longer after being gentled than the average.
      She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes Sedai.  According

  <li><a class="name" name="Perrin">Perrin t'Bashere Aybara</a>,
      p. 89&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field.  He is
      <i>ta'veren</i>.  When he and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated
      from the rest of the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight,
      Perrin met a man named <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a
      former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover
      the same ability in himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like
      the wolves' eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known
      to most as <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.
      Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta'veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very
      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other
      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helped considerably
      when helping <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge,
      but sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid.
      He returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc
      attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there,
      the first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.
      When he returned, he began to draw the eye of
      <a href="#Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</a>, the First of
      Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as
      possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile's
      dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand
      from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards
      (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most
      likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went
      to Ghealdan to see if he could tame <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>.  On the way, his
      wife was captured by Shaido, and now he must track her down.

      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, he went his own way, preaching

  <li><a class="name" name="Faile">Faile ni Bashere t'Aybara</a>,

      She is the daughter of <a href="#Bashere">Davram</a> and
      Deira Bashere, and their oldest surviving offspring.
      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      Mandarb was the name of <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> while
      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.
      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and
      that both he and Perrin are <i>ta'veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <a href="#Min">Min</a>'s viewings of Perrin.
      She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she can to
      make sure he not so much as <i>looks</i> at another woman, even though
      he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife, especially
      toward people like <a href="#Berelain">Berelain</a> who eye her husband
      all the time.  She even cornered <a href="#Min">Min</a> when they first
      came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure Min had no
      intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin to Ghealdan to find
      <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>, and while he was away her party was
      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <i>gai'shain</i> by
      them.

      wolves.  He did not find any problem with the ability by itself, but
      felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who thought they should
      gentle him (even though there was nothing to be gentled) because of his
      ability.  Elyas helped Perrin learn that he could talk to wolves as
      well; Perrin doesn't necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over
      the dislike of it as well.  The wolves call him
      Long Tooth.

      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least
      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for
      Nynaeve.  He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she
      leads.  According to the Wise Ones, <i><a href="#Aan">Aan'allein</a></i>
      (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.
      He is one of the best, if not <i>the</i> best, warriors in the
      World.

  <li><a class="name" name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>,
      p. 283 (320)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black
      Ajah.  She was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader
      was killed by <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> after she managed to kill
      off the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> without Ishamael's approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She serves as Keeper of the Chronicles
      under <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, despite being of a
      different Ajah than Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced
      to choose Alviarin in order to gain the support of the White Ajah when
      bringing charges against <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>; unknown to
      Elaida, this also brought her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without
      Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah would most likely have been divided
      over whether to depose Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida,
      which would most likely have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly
      even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is
      rapidly losing her power to Alviarin&mdash;and if Alviarin's loyalties
      are ever revealed, nothing will save either of them.  Alviarin has been
      shown how to Travel by <a href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</a>.

      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> back from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder
      is named <a href="#Tomas">Tomas</a>.  She is more interested in current
      events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what
      happened now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted
      stone ring <i>ter'angreal</i> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once
      told <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> that there was really no need to keep
      her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a
      novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway.  When
      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <a href="#Alanna">Alanna</a>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s sister <a href="#Bode">Bode</a>.  When she and
      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai
      means she is quite old indeed.

  <li><a class="name" name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      p. 311 (353)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was
      sent to the White Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered
      she had the ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a
      novice, she was good friends with
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      and was present at Gitara Moroso's
      Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  After being
      raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to
      finding and guiding the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and
      eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears
      (i.e., spies) before being raised to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was only thirty years old
      when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the
      youngest Amyrlin to date.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her
      Keeper of the Chronicles,
      Leane Sharif,
      were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</a>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use.
      In one of her viewings, <a href="#Min">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to
      remain close by to <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>&mdash;if she did
      not, both of them would die.
      Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that
      she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army.
      She had a Warder named Alric, but he died when
      she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She now serves
      as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a>, but though she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious to
      this fact.

  <li><a class="name" name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 311 (353)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien,
      she is <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>'s
      youngest half-sister, and King Laman's niece.
      She is considered short among her people, and the
      Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was discovered that she
      had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become
      an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> witnessed Gitara Moroso's Foretelling
      of the Rebirth of the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, along with two more <i>ta'veren</i>,
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>.
      When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <a href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Blight; she asked Lan
      to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is very strong in the Power,
      stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In the Stone of Tear,
      Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      Be'lal with balefire, just before he would have

      the testing <i>ter'angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> through the twisted
      doorway <i>ter'angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a> still thinks she
      &ldquo;bungled&rdquo; things with Rand.

      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.  He was born Barid Bel
      Medar one day after <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, and from
      the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments,
      almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never
      surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest
      generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred
      believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior,
      and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces
      over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of
      Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could
      finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually
      win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and
      that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light
      would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he
      transferred his hatred of Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his
      soul, <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>.  Demandred was recently told by
      the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to convert or destroy
      Rand, and promised him to be <a href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</a> if he
      succeeded.  However, since <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> has been declared
      Nae'blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin.  Demandred's assumed

  <li><a class="name" name="Semirhage">Semirhage</a>,
      p. 313 (355)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.
      During the Age of Legends, she was one of the
      best Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world
      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      Sammael sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained
      during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.  <i>Note:  there
      are many theories as to who Semirhage is masquerading as.  The only
      suggestion I have heard at this point makes some sense:

      to do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.
      She spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated
      her life to the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  During the War of Power,
      she created &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for the children, at which she taught
      the children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her
      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where
      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.
      She has been cooperating with <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> to some
      extent, and has taught <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> to Travel.  She
      was displeased that Alviarin had ordered <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>

      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.  It would fit, but I for one am not

      claiming that to use his true name would be blasphemy.
  <li><a class="name" name="Graendal">Graendal</a>,
      p. 313 (356)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  A fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change as she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  She worked with Sammael in the
      recent past, but since his disappearance has been working more closely
      with others.

      invariably both duelists died from the slow poison on the daggers.
      Osan'gar states that he helped make the Trollocs, indicating that in his

      in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore.  The
      sport fell from common practice, since almost invariably both duelists
      died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The other Forsaken consider
      Balthamel's new body a fine joke; the soul of Balthamel now occupies the
      body of a beautiful young woman.  She still channels <i>saidin</i>, and
      now serves as Delana's maid.  Delana does not know
      that she is one of the Chosen reincarned, just that she stands far above
      her among the Darkfriends.

      Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>
      and narrowed it to three boys in Emond's Field.
      While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      Mordeth in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from
      observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.
      Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear
      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      Ordeith, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak
      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He now served for a
      time as advisor to <a href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</a>, one of the
      Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  Rand has a bounty
      of 100,000 gold crowns on his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand's friends

      it was his homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it.  In
      addition, <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> is now hunting Fain, although

      Slayer) to kill him.
  <li><a class="name" name="Lanfear">Lanfear</a>,
      p. 318 (361)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in
      the Old Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile, and
      was very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out
      to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</a>, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <i>ter'angreal</i> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, becoming trapped.  Lanfear has since
      been reincarnated as <a href="#Cyndane">Cyndane</a> and fitted with a

      display for King Galldrian of Cairhien that went
      awry when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, although she
      believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the
      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved
      by <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> and <a href="#Thom">Thom</a> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She is now in
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  <i>Note:  it is
      widely speculated that Aludra is looking for a bellfounder for a
      specific reason:  she wants to build a cannon.</i>

      Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was
      governed by nobles who are not necessarily loyal to her.  She was the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this is the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by
      <a href="#Merilille">Merilille Ceandevin</a> of the Gray Ajah.  She is
      a widow, and does not plan to marry again.  However, she took an interest
      in <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat's usual tactic of
      chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>.  The two have
      been lovers for some time now, although Mat is not certain he could get
      out of the relationship should he see dire need to.  When the Seanchan
      invaded her nation, she cooperated with them out of necessity&mdash;they
      let her keep her position of authority, but is now a puppet of the

      carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier to the
      woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the
      <i>a'dam</i> should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring
      around her head).  Much to Egeanin's surprise, the <i>a'dam</i> held
      Bethamin just as well as it held the <i>damane</i> it was intended for.

<h3>Chapter 35:  With the Choedan Kal</h3>
<img src="../chapters/aessedai.gif" width="82" height="78" alt="Aes Sedai icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Ishamael">Ishamael</a>,
      p. 637 (744)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and during the Age
      of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian named Elan
      Morin Tedronai.  He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> to kill everyone he loved,
      pursuading the dying <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>
      not to accept the Aes Sedai Healing that might have saved his life,
      sending the Trollocs out of the Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars,
      and many other events in history that turned out poorly.
      When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from each other's throats.  He confronted
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>'s bonds; he confronted him again
      at Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <i>Callandor</i> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba'alzamon, which he called himself
      to the public, was a human being, and not the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.
      However, death is not always final with the Dark One; with the
      appearance of two other Foraken presumed dead, it is likely that
      Ishamael has been resurrected as well.

  <li><a class="name" name="Toma">Toma dur Ahmid</a>,
      p. 657 (767)&mdash;Person
      who devised the Toman Calendar, which was adopted approximately two

      p. 657 (767)&mdash;Person who
      proposed the Gazaran Calendar, which celebrated the alleged freedom from
      the Trolloc threat by recording Free Years (FY).  This calendar was
      adopted due to the chaos the resulted during the Trolloc Wars and the
      resulting confusion as to which year it actually was under the Toman
      Calendar.
  <li><a class="name" name="Uren">Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull</a>,
      p. 657 (767)&mdash;Sea Folk scholar and deviser of the

      New Era (NE).  This calendar is currently in use.

      She was responsible for promulgating the calendar that now bears her
      name, which measures years of the New Era (NE), the first of which
      marked the (arbitrary) end of the War.
  <li><a class="name" name="Niall">Lord Captain Commander Pedron Niall</a>,
      p. 658 (768)&mdash;Former Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light,
      highest officer among the Children.
      He was one of the great military commanders
      of the world, in company with <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      Agelmar Jagad, Rodel Ituralde,
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and
      several Aiel chiefs.  He was trying to get Altara and Murandy to cede
      land to Illian so the Council of Nine wouldn't invade both countries.
      He also tried to expand Amadicia's borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His
      headquarters were in Amadicia, and he ruled there even above
      <a href="#Ailron">King Ailron</a>, although this was not spoken of
      openly.  Niall recently offered a treaty with
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor,
      offering Whitecloak assistance to retake her throne in exchange
      for Whitecloak presence in Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence
      that Morgase had not allowed even a fraction of during her reign.
      Niall was killed by his alleged Spymaster,
      Abdel Omerna,
      who claimed he had gone against everything the Children stood for by
      allowing Morgase to avoid being put to the question.  He was replaced by
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>, who also killed Omerna.  Rumor puts him
      dead in a duel or a skirmish.

  <li><a class="name" name="Marcolin">First Captain Demetre Marcolin</a>,
      p. 658 (769)&mdash;First Captain of the Companions in Illian.
      He is lantern-jawed and

  <li><a class="name" name="Luthair">Emperor Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin</a>,
      p. 659 (769)&mdash;Son of <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>.
      He led the forces across the Aryth Ocean.  When they
      landed there, he led them to conquer the continent they found for
      themselves, and declared himself Emperor.  His descendants are the
      Seanchan &ldquo;of the Blood,&rdquo; and the rest of the Seanchan are
      descended from his troops and the native inhabitants.
  <li><a class="name" name="Tihera">Lord Rodrivar Tihera</a>,
      p. 661 (771)&mdash;Lean noble from Tear (a very minor noble).  Dark even for a
      Tairen, he has a short beard trimmed to a point.  He is the Captain of
      the Stone of Tear, the man who leads the Defenders.
  <li><a class="name" name="Jeraaal">Jeraal Mordeth</a>,
      p. 662 (772)&mdash;Name used by <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a> as a disguise to
      be one of <a href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</a>'s advisers.  It is the name
      of the man whose soul controls about half of Fain's mind.  Mordeth
      became a counsellor in Aridhol during the Trolloc
      Wars.  He advised that to defeat the Shadow, Aridhol must be harder than
      the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel.  Slowly it became so, until
      finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark.  The city
      finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand,
      every rock, every sip of water with its hatred.  Mordeth's soul remained
      in the city, now called Shadar Logoth ("Where the Shadow Waits") for
      millenia&mdash;he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a
      person to the city walls or had them carry something from the city to
      the outside world.  Strangely enough,
      both of these things happened at the same time,
      when <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> carried the ruby-handled
      dagger from the city while <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a> accompanied
      Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.  Mordeth attempted to
      consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to consume Mat's.  In Fain's
      case, the attempt to consume his soul was not completely
      successful&mdash;instead, the two souls merged to create something more
      evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels incomplete
      without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.
      Mordeth, Fain, or whatever you wish to call him has since deserted
      Toram.
